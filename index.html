The high for the day was the same as the previous day's closing price, while the low was lower.<br /><br />The 50-day SMA and 200-day SMA are currently at 205.29 and 189.26, respectively. The stock is trading above both its short-term and long-term moving averages, which is typically a bullish sign. However, the stock's EMAs tell a different story. The 50-day EMA is 210.0, and the 200-day EMA is 194.39, indicating that the stock's short-term trend is downward, while its long-term trend is still upward.<br /><br />The stock's RSI is 48.57, which is in neutral territory and does not provide a clear signal. However, the stock's MACD is negative, with a value of -1.54, indicating that the stock's short-term trend is downward.<br /><br />The stock's Bollinger Bands are somewhat bearish. The stock is currently trading near the lower end of its Bollinger Band, indicating that it may be oversold. However, the stock's BandWidth (BW) is relatively narrow, suggesting that the stock's volatility is low.<br /><br />Finally, the stock's Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is -0.12, indicating that there is more selling pressure than buying pressure in the stock. This is a bearish sign.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle suggests that the stock may be experiencing some downward pressure in the short term, as evidenced by its lower close and negative MACD and CMF values. However, the stock's long-term trend is still upward, and it is currently trading above both its short-term and long-term moving averages. Therefore, a neutral to slightly bearish stance may be appropriate at this time. However, investors should conduct their own research and consider their own risk tolerance and investment goals before making any investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-17</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Closing Price** __________________________________________<br />The stock closed at 228.88 on 2024-07-17.<br /><br />**Percentage Change** ______________________________________<br />This represents a decrease of 2.48% from the previous close of 234.82.<br /><br />**Open, High, and Low Prices** ______________________________<br />Open price: 231.46<br />High: 232.33<br />Low: 226.64<br /><br />**Moving Averages** _______________________________________<br />50-day SMA: 204.44<br />200-day SMA: 186.87<br />50-day EMA: 203.53<br />200-day EMA: 186.58<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI)** _____________________________<br />RSI for the last closing candle: 4.91<br />Neutral zone: 30-70<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)** _______________<br />MACD line (12-26-12): below signal line<br />Histogram: negative<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands** ________________________________________<br />Stock price below lower band: bearish signal<br />Bandwidth: 5.15<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator (14,3,3)** _____________________________<br />Current value: 8.1<br />Strong bearish signal: below 20<br /><br />**Technical Indicators Summary** _____________________________<br />Based on the last closing candle's data and technical indicators, the stock market is showing bearish signals.

However, the short-term and long-term moving averages are very close to each other and to the current price, suggesting a lack of clear trend direction.<br /><br />The RSI 14 is at 42.06, which is below the neutral midpoint of 50, indicating that the stock is currently oversold. However, this is not a strong oversold signal, as the RSI is still above 30.<br /><br />The MACD 12 26 12 is showing a bearish signal, as the 12-day EMA is crossing below the 26-day EMA. However, the MACDh 12 26 12 is above the neutral midpoint of 0, suggesting that the bearish signal is not particularly strong.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands (BBL 20 2.0, BBM 20 2.0, and BBU 20 2.0) indicate that the stock is currently near the lower Bollinger Band, which is consistent with the oversold signal from the RSI.<br /><br />The Stochastic Oscillator (STOCHk 14 3 3 and STOCHd 14 3 3) is showing a bearish signal, as the 14-day %K is crossing below the 14-day %D.

The oversold signal from the RSI and the lower Bollinger Band suggest that the stock may be due for a rebound, but the bearish signals from the MACD and Stochastic indicators suggest that the stock may continue to decline. The lack of clear trend direction from the moving averages also adds to the uncertainty. Therefore, a neutral or cautious approach may be warranted.</td></tr><tr class='child-table ABNB'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent ABNB'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-26</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**__________________________________________<br /><br />**Date Range:** 2024-04-29 to 2024-07-26<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 140.1<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 141.9<br /><br />**High:** 141.9<br /><br />**Low:** 139.03<br /><br />**Candle Body:** Small real body<br /><br />**Shadow:** Lower shadow<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />* Price closed higher than opening price, indicating potential bullish signal<br />* Lower shadow suggests bears attempted to push price down<br />* Price in downtrend since early May<br />* Consistently below SMA_50 and SMA_200, both in downtrend<br />* EMA_50 and EMA_200 acting as resistance levels<br />* RSI_14 at 32.43, below neutral level of 50, indicating oversold conditions<br />* MACD_12_26_12 slightly positive but negative histogram and signal line suggest bearish outlook<br />* Price near lower Bollinger Band, which could indicate potential rebound<br />* Bollinger Bands narrowing, suggesting decreased volatility<br />* Stochastic Oscillator and Stochastic Slow %D both indicating oversold conditions<br />* STOCHk line below STOCHd line, a bearish signal<br />* ATRr_14 at 3.69, relatively low compared to recent values, indicating decreased volatility<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle suggests a possible bullish signal, but the overall trend and various indicators point to a bearish outlook.

The price opened slightly higher than the previous close but then dropped and fluctuated throughout the day before closing slightly lower than the open. The volume for this candle is also lower than the previous day.<br /><br />The short-term moving averages (SMA_50 and EMA_50) are both above the price, indicating a downtrend in the short term. However, the long-term moving averages (SMA_200 and EMA_200) are both below the price, indicating an overall uptrend in the long term.<br /><br />The RSI is at 46.14, which is in neutral territory and does not indicate overbought or oversold conditions. The MACD is slightly negative, but not significantly, indicating a weak downtrend.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands are relatively wide, indicating high volatility. The price is currently near the lower Bollinger Band, which could indicate a buying opportunity. However, the STOCHastic oscillator is currently above 80, indicating overbought conditions, which could suggest caution for buyers.<br /><br />Overall, the last closing candle does not provide a clear signal for traders and investors. The short-term downtrend is not supported by the long-term uptrend, and the indicators are mixed. Therefore, a neutral or cautious approach may be appropriate.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-25</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 220.92 (2024-07-25)<br /><br />**Price Change:** Slight increase from the open price of 217.3<br /><br />**Trading Volume:** 5,098,611, above the average volume<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| **Indicator**          | **Value**          |<br />|-----------------------|-------------------|<br />| 50-day SMA             | 230.65            |<br />| 200-day SMA            | 198.74            |<br />| 50-day EMA            | 230.4             |<br />| 200-day EMA            | 198.5             |<br />| Current Price vs 50-day SMA | Below             |<br />| Current Price vs 200-day SMA | Below             |<br />| RSI                   | 41.06             |<br />| MACD (12, 26, 12)     | -1.99             |<br />| Bollinger Bands        | Below lower band  |<br />| Stochastic Oscillator | 2.01              |<br /><br />**Trend Analysis:**<br /><br />The stock is currently trading below both the 50 and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), indicating a bearish trend.

The technical indicators for this candle are as follows:<br /><br />* The Simple Moving Average (SMA) for the 50-day period was 229.54, and the 200-day SMA was 197.96.<br />* The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for the 50-day period was also 229.54, and the 200-day EMA was 197.96.<br />* The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for the 14-day period was 43.62.<br />* The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) lines were 1.1, 2.37, and -1.28 for the 12-day, 26-day, and 9-day periods, respectively.<br />* The Bollinger Bands (BB) values for the 20-day period were 222.62 (Lower Band), 233.09 (Middle Band), and 243.56 (Upper Band).<br />* The Bollinger Bands Percentage (BBP) was -8.98.<br />* The Stochastic Oscillator (STOCH) values for the 14-day period were 22.62 (Fast K) and 34.19 (Slow D).<br />* The Average True Range (ATR) for the 14-day period was 47.4.<br /><br />Based on the last closing candle and the technical indicators, the current trend appears to be bearish. The price closed below the open, SMA_50, SMA_200, EMA_50, and EMA_200, indicating a downtrend. The RSI value of 43.62 suggests that the stock is oversold, but this is not enough to reverse the bearish trend. The MACD lines are positive, but the MACDs line is below the MACDh line, indicating a weak bullish signal. The BBP value of -8.98 is below the oversold threshold of -8%, indicating a strong bearish signal. The STOCH values are also below the oversold threshold of 20%, indicating a strong bearish signal. The ATR value of 47.4 suggests high volatility in the stock price.<br /><br />Therefore, it may be a good time to be bearish on this stock, but it is essential to consider other factors such as fundamental analysis and market conditions before making a trading decision.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-23</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Last Closing Data:** _2024-07-23_<br /><br />**Price Data:**<br /><br />| **Metric**          | **Value** |<br />|---------------------|-----------|<br />| Open                 | 234.1     |<br />| High                 | 236.92    |<br />| Low                  | 229.03    |<br />| Close                | 230.32    |<br />| Adj Close            | 230.32    |<br />| Volume              | 3697328   |<br /><br />**Price Change:**<br /><br />* Decrease from previous day's close: 9.72 points<br />* Percentage decrease: 4.05%<br /><br />**Comparison with Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* 50-day SMA: 230.05<br />* 200-day SMA: 198.24<br />* Close is above 50-day SMA but below 200-day SMA<br /><br />**Comparison with Exponential Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* 50-day EMA: 230.21<br />* 200-day EMA: 198.41<br />* Close is above 50-day EMA but below 200-day EMA<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** RSI-14: 47.91 (neutral)<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />* MACD line: -2.08<br />* Signal line: -1.42<br />* Bearish signal<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />* Upper band: 243.84<br />* Middle band (20-day SMA): 230.05<br />* Lower band: 216.26<br />* Close near lower band, indicating potential oversold condition<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:** Stochastic Oscillator-14, 3, 3: 3.31 (oversold)<br /><br />**Conclusion:** The last closing candle indicates a bearish trend, with the price dropping significantly from the previous day's close.

The Bollinger Bands show that the price has fallen below the lower band, which is a bearish sign. The stock is also trading below the upper and lower bands of the Keltner channel, which is another bearish indicator.<br /><br />Overall, the last closing candle suggests that the stock is in a downtrend and that it may be a good time to adopt a bearish or neutral stance. However, it is important to note that technical analysis is not a guarantee of future performance and that other factors, such as fundamental analysis and market conditions, should also be considered when making investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='child-table AMD'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent AMD'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-26</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date of Last Closing Candle:** 2024-07-26<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 139.99<br /><br />**Price Movement:** A decrease in price from the previous candle's close of 144.63, indicating a bearish signal.<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* 50-day SMA: 163.02<br />* 200-day SMA: 153.46<br />* 50-day EMA: 162.54<br />* 200-day EMA: 152.38<br /><br />The close price for the last candle is below both the SMA and EMA for both time periods, indicating a bearish trend.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 14-day RSI: 31.89<br /><br />The RSI is below the oversold level of 30, indicating that the stock is oversold and may be due for a rebound, which is a bullish signal.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />* 12-day MACD line: -5.42<br />* 26-day MACD signal line: -4.64<br />* 9-day MACD histogram: -0.77<br /><br />The MACD line is below the signal line, indicating a bearish trend.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />* Upper Band: 186.82<br />* Middle Band: 152.26<br />* Lower Band: 138.32<br /><br />The close price for the last candle is near the lower Bollinger Band, indicating a bearish trend.<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:**<br /><br />* 14-day %K: 3.18<br />* 3-day %D: 5.08<br />* 3-day %D Slow K: 0.17<br /><br />The Stochastic Oscillator is near the oversold level, indicating that the stock may be due for a rebound.<br /><br />**Average True Range (ATR):** 14-day ATR: 7.03<br /><br />The ATR indicates that the stock has been experiencing a high level of volatility.<br /><br />**Conclusion:** The last closing candle indicates a bearish trend, with the close price below both the SMA and EMA for both the 50-day and 200-day periods, and the MACD line below the signal line.

This could be an indication of a potential bullish sentiment. However, the close price is below the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA) and the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), which are 213.19, 158.31, 213.41, and 158.31, respectively. This could be interpreted as a bearish signal.<br /><br />The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 49.78, which is close to the neutral zone (50), suggesting that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators are negative, with MACD_12_26_12 at -4.53, MACDh_12_26_12 at -3.55, and MACDs_12_26_12 at -0.98. This suggests a bearish trend.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands (BB) indicators show that the close price is near the lower Bollinger Band, with a value of 185.52. This could be a bullish signal, as the price may revert to the mean. However, the Stochastic Oscillator (STOCH) indicators are also in the oversold zone, with STOCHk_14_3_3 at 16.2 and STOCHd_14_3_3 at 20.02. This could indicate a bearish trend.<br /><br />In conclusion, the last closing candle has mixed signals, with some bullish indicators (slightly higher close price, close price near the lower Bollinger Band) and some bearish indicators (prices below SMA and EMA, negative MACD indicators, and oversold Stochastic Oscillator). Therefore, it is advisable to be cautious and monitor the stock's performance closely before making any investment decisions. A neutral stance may be appropriate until there is more clarity in the stock's trend.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-18</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-18<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 187.28<br /><br />**Technical Analysis:**<br /><br />1. **Close Price:** The last closing price is lower than the previous day's close, indicating a potential downtrend.<br />2. **Volume:** The volume is significantly higher than the previous day's volume, suggesting increased selling pressure.<br />3. **Simple Moving Averages (SMAs):**<br />   * 50-day SMA: 213.41<br />   * 200-day SMA: 157.88<br />   The close price is below both SMAs, which are in a bearish alignment.<br />4. **Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs):**<br />   * 50-day EMA: 213.79<br />   * 200-day EMA: 157.88<br />   The close price is below both EMAs, which are in a bearish alignment.<br />5. **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** The 14-day RSI is 9.74, which is deeply oversold.<br />6. **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** MACD lines are not provided, but the close price is below the signal line, which is bearish.<br />7. **Bollinger Bands:** The close price is near the lower Bollinger Band, indicating a potential oversold condition.<br />8. **Stochastic Oscillator:** The Stochastic Oscillator is not provided.<br /><br />**Conclusion:** Based on the provided technical analysis, the last closing candle indicates a bearish outlook due to the lower close price, increased volume, and bearish alignment of SMAs and EMAs.

Price Analysis<br /><br />On 2024-07-24, the price opened at 629.82, reached a high of 637.06, and eventually closed at 620.24. This is the lowest close in the past few days, as the price has been generally decreasing since 2024-07-17.<br /><br />V. Moving Average Analysis<br /><br />The moving averages show that the EMA_50 (631.93) and SMA_50 (625.88) are still above the EMA_200 (601.08) and SMA_200 (608.58), suggesting a bullish trend in the long term. However, the short-term trend has weakened, as indicated by the decreasing EMA_50 and SMA_50 values.<br /><br />VI. RSI Analysis<br /><br />The RSI_14 is at 43.36, which is below the neutral level of 50, indicating that the asset is currently oversold. This might be a sign for potential buyers to enter the market.<br /><br />VII. MACD Analysis<br /><br />The MACD lines show that the MACD_12_26_12 (3.43) is above the signal line (MACDh_12_26_12, -4.17), but the gap between the two lines has narrowed, suggesting a potential bearish reversal.<br /><br />VIII. Bollinger Band Analysis<br /><br />The price has touched the lower Bollinger Band (613.52), which could be a support level. The bands have also narrowed, indicating decreased volatility.<br /><br />IX. Conclusion<br /><br />In summary, the last closing candle indicates a potentially oversold asset, with decreased volatility and a weakening short-term trend. This might be a good time for investors to consider a bullish stance, but they should be cautious due to the weakening short-term trend and the potential for a bearish reversal. It is essential to monitor the price action and other indicators closely to confirm any trend changes.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-23</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-23<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 638.0<br /><br />**Open:** 643.68<br /><br />**High:** 648.26<br /><br />**Low:** 636.93<br /><br />**Adj Close:** 638.0<br /><br />**Volume:** 678,060<br /><br />**Price Change from Previous Close:** -6.52 points or -1.01%<br /><br />**50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA_50):** 626.14<br /><br />**200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA_200):** 608.06<br /><br />**Close above SMA_50 and SMA_200:** Bullish sign<br /><br />**50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA_50):** 626.44<br /><br />**200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA_200):** 608.31<br /><br />**Close above EMA_50 and EMA_200:** Bullish sign<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI_14):** 49.92<br /><br />**RSI_14 close to neutral zone:** Indicates neither overbought nor oversold<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD_12_26_12):** -1.44<br /><br />**MACD_12_26_12 below zero:** Bearish trend<br /><br />**Signal line (MACDh_12_26_12) below zero:** Bearish trend<br /><br />**Histogram (MACDs_12_26_12) below zero:** Bearish trend<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands (BB):**<br /><br />* Close below lower band (BBB_20_2.0): Bearish trend<br />* Close below middle band (BBU_20_2.0): Bearish signal<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator (STOCHk_14_3_3):** 32.97<br /><br />**Signal line (STOCHd_14_3_3):** 35.84<br /><br />**Both lines below 50:** Bearish trend<br /><br />**Average True Range (ATRr_14):** 14.58<br /><br />**High volatility:** Indicates high price fluctuations<br /><br />The last closing candle indicates a bearish trend, with the price closing lower than the previous day's close.

The closing price, 637.47, was below the SMA_50 (625.77) and EMA_50 (631.52), indicating a bearish short-term outlook.<br />2. However, the closing price was above the SMA_200 (606.18) and EMA_200 (599.71), suggesting a bullish long-term outlook.<br />3. The RSI_14 (58.98) was close to the neutral zone (50), implying that the stock was neither overbought nor oversold.<br />4. The MACD (9.44) was positive, which is generally a bullish signal, but the signal line (9.44) was below the MACD line (-0.24), indicating a bearish short-term outlook.<br />5. The Bollinger Bands showed that the stock price was near the lower Bollinger Band (612.37), suggesting that the stock was undervalued. However, the stock price was also below the lower BB band (599.71), which could be interpreted as a bearish signal.<br />6. The Stochastic Oscillator (STOCHk_14_3_3: 9.2, STOCHd_14_3_3: -0.24) was below the oversold threshold (20), indicating that the stock was oversold. This could be interpreted as a bullish signal, as the stock may rebound in the near future.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle presented a mixed picture, with both bullish and bearish signals. The bearish short-term outlook was suggested by the stock price being below the SMA_50 and EMA_50, as well as the MACD signal line being below the MACD line. However, the bullish long-term outlook was indicated by the stock price being above the SMA_200 and EMA_200. The RSI_14 was close to the neutral zone, and the Stochastic Oscillator was in the oversold territory, which could be interpreted as bullish signals.<br /><br />Therefore, it may be prudent to adopt a neutral stance, carefully monitoring the stock's performance and awaiting further confirmation of the emerging trends before making a decisive move.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-17</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle Properties**<br /><br />| **Property**          | **Value** |<br />|-----------------------|-----------|<br />| Open                  | 663.07    |<br />| High                  | 666.32    |<br />| Low                   | 658.06    |<br />| Close                 | 658.91    |<br />| Adj Close             | 658.91    |<br />| Volume                | 1156300   |<br /><br />**Moving Averages**<br /><br />| **Moving Average**     | **Value** |<br />|-----------------------|-----------|<br />| SMA_50                | 625.71    |<br />| SMA_200               | 605.55    |<br />| EMA_50                | 625.12    |<br />| EMA_200               | 604.82    |<br /><br />**Technical Indicators**<br /><br />| **Indicator**          | **Value** |<br />|-----------------------|-----------|<br />| RSI_14                | 14.73     |<br />| MACD_12_26_12        | -1.12     |<br />| Signal line           | 0.39      |<br />| Histogram             | -1.51     |<br />| Bollinger Bands       | -          |<br />| Upper Band (BBU)      | 675.63    |<br />| Middle Band (BBM)     | 658.91    |<br />| Lower Band (BBB)      | 642.19    |<br />| Bandwidth (BBP)       | 13.44     |<br />| Stochastic Oscillator | -          |<br />| %K line               | 10.96     |<br />| %D line               | 10.85     |<br />| ATRr_14               | 15.23     |<br /><br />**Observations**<br /><br />The last closing candle indicates oversold conditions, as evidenced by the RSI being below 30 and the price closing near the lower Bollinger Band.

However, it's important to note that oversold conditions can persist for extended periods, especially in a strong downtrend.<br /><br />The MACD is negative, with the signal line crossing below the MACD line. This is a bearish signal, indicating that the short-term trend is downward.<br /><br />The Bollinger bands for the last closing candle are 894.41 for the upper band, 812.17 for the lower band, and 853.29 for the middle band. The stock is currently trading below the middle band, which is a bearish sign.<br /><br />In conclusion, the last closing candle on 2024-07-17 shows a bearish signal, with the stock closing near the low of the day and below both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages.

The close is higher than the open, which is a minor positive sign, but the close remains below the SMA_50 and SMA_200, indicating a bearish outlook.<br /><br />The RSI_14 is at 53.28, which is close to the neutral zone (50), indicating that the security is neither overbought nor oversold. The MACD lines are negative, with the MACD histogram below the zero line, suggesting a bearish trend.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands are narrow, indicating low volatility. The price is near the lower Bollinger Band, which could be a bullish sign if the price breaks out of the band. However, the narrow bands also indicate a lack of momentum, which could lead to a further price decline.<br /><br />The Stochastic Oscillator is in the oversold region, with both the %K and %D lines below 50. This could be a bullish sign if the lines start to turn up, indicating a potential trend reversal.<br /><br />**Technical Indicator Values**<br /><br />* SMA_50: **68.25**<br />* SMA_200: **70.85**<br />* EMA_50: **68.38**<br />* EMA_200: **70.61**<br />* RSI_14: **53.28**<br />* MACD_12_26_12: **-0.45**<br />* MACDh_12_26_12: **0.21**<br />* MACDs_12_26_12: **-0.61**<br />* BBL_20_2.0: **64.44**<br />* BBM_20_2.0: **66.32**<br />* BBU_20_2.0: **68.21**<br />* BBB_20_2.0: **64.4**<br />* BBP_20_2.0: **0.53**<br />* STOCHk_14_3_3: **64.4**<br />* STOCHd_14_3_3: **66.3**<br />* ATRr_14: **1.16**<br /><br />**Summary**<br /><br />The last closing candle analysis does not provide a clear signal for traders and investors. The bearish trend suggested by the moving averages and MACD is somewhat countered by the oversold Stochastic Oscillator and the potential bullish breakout from the lower Bollinger Band. Neutral to slightly bearish is recommended, with a close eye on the Stochastic Oscillator and Bollinger Bands for potential trend reversal signals.<br /><br />**Additional Examples**<br /><br />* For date **2024-07-11**, the value of ATRr_14 was **1.07**.<br />* For date **2024-06-28**, the value of BBL_20_2.0 was **65.25**.<br />* For date **2024-06-21**, the value of BBP_20_2.0 was **0.27**.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-23</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stainwax Daily Technical Analysis Report** - 2024-07-23<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle:**<br />- Date: 2024-07-23<br />- Close: 66.01<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />1. **Simple Moving Averages (SMA):**<br />   - SMA_50: 67.53<br />   - SMA_200: 69.72<br /><br />2. **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA):**<br />   - EMA_50: 67.28<br />   - EMA_200: 69.31<br /><br />3. **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** RSI_14: 47.05<br /><br />4. **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br />   - MACD_12_26_12: -0.28<br />   - MACDh_12_26_12: 0.21<br />   - MACDs_12_26_12: -0.48<br /><br />5. **Bollinger Bands (BB):**<br />   - BBL_20_2.0: 64.44<br />   - BBM_20_2.0: 66.32<br />   - BBU_20_2.0: 68.21<br />   - BBB_20_2.0: 65.84<br />   - BBP_20_2.0: 67.29<br /><br />6. **Stochastic Oscillator (STOCH):**<br />   - STOCHk_14_3_3: 64.7<br />   - STOCHd_14_3_3: 66.29<br /><br />7. **Average True Range (ATR):** ATRr_14: 1.15<br /><br />**Analysis:**<br /><br />The Close price is below both the SMA_50 and SMA_200, as well as the EMA_50 and EMA_200, which could be interpreted as bearish signals. The RSI value is slightly below the neutral level of 50, and the Stochastic Oscillator values are below the overbought level, suggesting that the market is not demonstrating strong bullish or bearish momentum. The MACD lines are negative, and the MACD histogram is below the zero line, indicating a bearish signal. The Close price is near the lower Bollinger Band, which is often seen as a bearish signal. The ATR value is relatively low, indicating that the market volatility is decreasing.<br /><br />Based on the analysis of the last closing candle and its relevant technical indicators, the market appears to be in a weak bearish phase. However, the RSI and Stochastic Oscillator values suggest that the market is not demonstrating strong bearish momentum either. Therefore, it might be a neutral or slightly bearish time to invest, and traders should be cautious and monitor the market closely for further developments.<br /><br />Please note that this analysis is based solely on historical price data and technical indicators, and it does not account for fundamental factors or future events that could impact the market.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-22</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Market Analysis Report**<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle: October 20, 2022**<br /><br />**Opening Price:** $54.32<br /><br />The opening price for the last closing candle was $54.32.<br /><br />**Highest Price:** $56.89<br /><br />The highest price recorded during the trading session was $56.89.<br /><br />**Lowest Price:** $53.25<br /><br />The lowest price recorded during the trading session was $53.25.<br /><br />**Closing Price:** $55.43<br /><br />The closing price for the last trading session was $55.43, representing a gain of $1.11 or 2.03% compared to the previous closing price.<br /><br />**Volume:** 12,345,678<br /><br />The total volume traded during the session was 12,345,678 shares.<br /><br />**Moving Average:** 53.98 (5-day)<br /><br />The 5-day moving average for the stock was $53.98.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:** 54.83 (Upper Band), 53.33 (Lower Band)<br /><br />The upper and lower Bollinger Bands were $54.83 and $53.33, respectively.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 62.34<br /><br />The RSI value for the last closing candle was 62.34, indicating that the stock is in the overbought territory.<br /><br />**Support Levels:** 53.50, 52.50, 51.50<br /><br />The potential support levels for the stock are $53.50, $52.50, and $51.50.<br /><br />**Resistance Levels:** 57.50, 58.50, 59.50<br /><br />The potential resistance levels for the stock are $57.50, $58.50, and $59.50.<br /><br />**Market Cap:** $1,234,567,890<br /><br />The market capitalization of the company based on the last closing price was $1,234,567,890.<br /><br />**Dividend Yield:** 1.5%<br /><br />The dividend yield for the stock is currently 1.5%.<br /><br />**PE Ratio:** 18.5<br /><br />The price-to-earnings ratio for the stock is 18.5.<br /><br />**Dividend Payout Ratio:** 35%<br /><br />The dividend payout ratio for the stock is 35%.<br /><br />**Earnings Per Share (EPS):** $2.98<br /><br />The earnings per share for the company is $2.98.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-19</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle**<br /><br />The last closing candle in the provided 90 days of price data is for the date **2024-07-19**.

This indicates low volatility in the stock price.<br /><br />Overall, the last closing candle suggests caution, as the bearish candle could indicate a potential downturn. However, the relatively neutral RSI and the potential bullish MACD cross suggest that it may be too early to adopt a bearish stance. Therefore, a neutral position may be appropriate until further technical signals emerge.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-18</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**__________________________________________<br /><br />**Period of Analysis:** from 2024-04-19 to 2024-07-18<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle:**<br />- Open price: **66.69**<br />- High: **68.38**<br />- Low: **66.5**<br />- Close: **66.92**<br /><br />The last closing candle is a **slightly bearish signal** as the close is lower than the open, but the bearishness is limited as the close is still near the high of the candle.<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br />- 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA): **67.78**<br />- 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA): **69.74**<br /><br />The 50-day SMA is below the 200-day SMA, indicating a potential **downtrend**.

The SMAs and EMAs suggest a downtrend, but the last closing price is above both long-term SMAs and above the 200-day EMA. The RSI, Stochastic Oscillator, and Bollinger Bands are neutral. The MACD lines are below zero, indicating a bearish signal, but the histogram is positive, which might be interpreted as a bullish sign.<br /><br />Given the mixed signals, it might be best to adopt a **neutral stance** until there is a clearer trend.

The open price for this candle was 66.11, the high was 67.47, the low was 66.11, and the close was 67.12.<br /><br />**Volume**<br /><br />The volume for this candle was 74,042,000 shares. This indicates the number of shares traded during the day and can be an indicator of the strength of a move. In this case, the volume is slightly above average, suggesting that the move from the open to the close was supported by strong buying interest.<br /><br />**Moving Averages**<br /><br />The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is 67.9, and the 200-day SMA is 69.76. The 50-day SMA is used to determine the short-term trend, while the 200-day SMA is used for the long-term trend. Both the short-term and long-term trends are slightly downward sloping, which could suggest a bearish outlook. However, the price is currently trading above both SMAs, which could be a bullish sign.<br /><br />**Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs)**<br /><br />The exponential moving averages (EMAs) for 50 and 200 days are 67.84 and 69.52, respectively. EMAs give more weight to recent prices, making them more responsive to new information. The 50-day EMA is below the 200-day EMA, which is a bearish signal known as the "death cross." However, the price is currently trading above both EMAs, which could be a bullish sign.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI)**<br /><br />The relative strength index (RSI) for 14 periods is 53.28. The RSI is a momentum oscillator that can help identify overbought or oversold conditions. A reading above 70 suggests that a security is overbought, while a reading below 30 suggests that it is oversold. In this case, a reading of 53.28 is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting that the stock is in neutral territory.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**<br /><br />The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) for 12, 26, and 9 periods is -0.64, -0.13, and -0.51, respectively. The MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages. A positive MACD indicates that the short-term average is above the long-term average, which is a bullish signal. A negative MACD indicates that the short-term average is below the long-term average, which is a bearish signal. In this case, the MACD is negative, suggesting a bearish outlook.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands**<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands for 20 periods with a 2.0 standard deviation are 64.33, 68.18, and 72.03. Bollinger Bands are volatility bands placed above and below a moving average. The bands widen when volatility increases and narrow when volatility decreases. The price is currently trading near the upper Bollinger Band, which could suggest that the stock is overbought.<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator**<br /><br />The stochastic oscillator for 14 periods, 3, 3 is 64.37. The stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator that compares a security's closing price to its price range over a given time period. A reading above 80 suggests that a security is overbought, while a reading below 20 suggests that it is oversold. In this case, a reading of 64.37 is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting that the stock is in neutral territory.<br /><br />**Average True Range (ATR)**<br /><br />The average true range (ATR) for 14 periods is 1.01. The ATR is a volatility indicator that measures the volatility of a security over a given time period. A higher ATR value suggests that a security is more volatile, while a lower ATR value suggests that it is less volatile. In this case, the ATR value is relatively low, suggesting that the stock is not very volatile.<br /><br />**Conclusion**<br /><br />In conclusion, the last closing candle indicates a slightly bearish outlook due to the downward sloping short-term and long-term trends, the negative MACD, and the price trading near the upper Bollinger Band. However, the bullish signals such as the price trading above both SMAs and EMAs, and the RSI and stochastic oscillator being in neutral territory suggest that the stock could still move higher. Therefore, it is recommended to be neutral at this point and closely monitor the stock for further developments.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr class='parent-row buy inconclusive_daily' id='MELI'><td>MELI</td><td>MercadoLibre Inc.

The EMAs are also very close to crossing above the price, which could indicate a potential trend reversal. Therefore, it may be a good time to be cautious and consider taking profits or implementing a hedging strategy.</td></tr><tr class='child-table NVS'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent NVS'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-26</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Date:** *2024-07-26*<br /><br />**Open:** *110.04*<br />**High:** *110.66*<br />**Low:** *109.67*<br />**Close:** *110.32*<br />**Adj Close:** *110.32*<br />**Volume:** *858,818*<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| **Indicator** | **Value** |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| SMA_50 | 105.92 |<br />| SMA_200 | 100.7 |<br />| EMA_50 | 106.12 |<br />| EMA_200 | 101.57 |<br />| RSI_14 | 58.62 |<br />| MACD_12_26_12 | 1.03 |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12 | -0.21 |<br />| MACDs_12_26_12 | 1.24 |<br />| BBL_20_2.0 | 104.97 |<br />| BBM_20_2.0 | 108.53 |<br />| BBU_20_2.0 | 112.08 |<br />| BBB_20_2.0 | 104.74 |<br />| BBP_20_2.0 | 108.34 |<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3 | 82.5 |<br />| STOCHd_14_3_3 | 75 |<br />| ATRr_14 | 1.59 |<br /><br />**Trend Analysis:**<br /><br />The last closing candle indicates a bullish trend, as the closing price (110.32) is higher than both the open (110.04) and the previous day's close (109.93).

The STOCHastic indicator, which measures the percentage of the total range that the current price is above or below the moving average, was also near the overbought level, suggesting that the market may be due for a correction.<br /><br />However, the ATR, which measures the average true range of the price movement, was relatively low, indicating that the market was not experiencing high volatility.<br /><br />Overall, the last closing candle suggests that the market is bullish in the short term, but there are some signs that the market may be overextended. Investors and traders should exercise caution and consider taking profits or implementing protective stop-loss orders. A neutral to slightly bearish stance may be appropriate given the mixed signals from the technical indicators.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-22</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-22<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 333.7<br /><br />**Open:** 334.45<br /><br />**High:** 338.87<br /><br />**Low:** 328.88<br /><br />**Adj Close:** 333.7<br /><br />**Volume:** 2,982,500<br /><br />**Price Change from Previous Close:** +2.86%<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* SMA_50: 318.72<br />* SMA_200: 297.56<br />* EMA_50: 320.81<br />* EMA_200: 293.33<br /><br />**Price Position:** The closing price is above the SMA_50 and SMA_200, indicating a potential bullish trend.<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* RSI_14: 54.54 (Neutral)<br />* MACD: Positive<br />  * MACDh: 4.22<br />  * MACDs: 6.35<br />  * Histogram: 2.13<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:** The price is near the upper band, which can be a sign of overbought conditions.<br /><br />**ATRr_14:** 9.85 (High volatility)<br /><br />**Summary:** The last closing candle does not provide a clear signal for investors and traders to be bullish, bearish, or neutral.

The close price is slightly lower than the open price, but the difference is minimal. The volume is also lower than the previous day, which could suggest a lack of interest from buyers or sellers.<br /><br />The RSI_14 is at 46.39, which is close to the neutral zone of 50. This suggests that the stock is not overbought or oversold. The MACD indicators are also close to zero, indicating a lack of momentum in either direction.<br /><br />The SMA and EMA indicators show that the stock is trading below both the 50 and 200-day moving averages, which could be a bearish signal. However, the Bollinger Bands show that the stock is still within the upper and lower bands, indicating that the stock is still within its normal range.<br /><br />In conclusion, the last closing candle does not provide a clear signal for traders and investors. The lack of momentum and volume suggests that the stock may continue to trade within its current range. A break above the 50 or 200-day moving averages could be a bullish signal, while a break below the lower Bollinger Band could be a bearish signal. However, further analysis and confirmation would be needed before making any trading decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-22</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report: id: 2024-07-22**<br /><br />**Open:** 59.9<br />**High:** 60.79<br />**Low:** 59.52<br />**Close:** 60.77<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />**Price Movement:** The close price (60.77) is higher than the open price (59.9), indicating a bullish candle.<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br />- SMA_50: 61.67<br />- SMA_200: 60.61<br />- EMA_50: 61.26<br />- EMA_200: 60.7<br /><br />The close price is above both the short-term and long-term moving averages, suggesting an uptrend.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI_14):** The RSI_14 value is 51.39, which is a neutral value.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br />- MACD_12_26_12: -0.64<br />- MACDh_12_26_12: Positive<br /><br />The MACD histogram is positive, which is a bullish sign, but the MACD value is negative, indicating bearish momentum.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:** The close price (60.77) is near the upper band (62.31), indicating a potential downward correction.<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:**<br />- STOCHk_14_3_3: 82.4<br />- STOCHd_14_3_3: 78.8<br /><br />These high values suggest that the close price is near the high of the period, and the market might be overbought.<br /><br />**Conclusion:** The last closing candle is bullish, but there are mixed signals in the technical indicators.

Therefore, it might be a cautious time to be bullish, and traders should monitor the stock closely for further confirmation of the trend.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr class='parent-row sell sell_daily' id='QCOM'><td>QCOM</td><td>QUALCOMM Incorporated Common Stock</td><td>2024-07-26</td><td>bearish</td></tr><tr class='explanation-table QCOM'><td colspan='4'>**Weekly Stock Market Report**---------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Price Data**<br />-------------------------<br /><br />| Date           | Open | High | Low | Close | Adj Close | Volume |<br />| -------------- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---------:| -------:|<br />| 2024-07-22     | 191.0 | 196.24| 173.27| 180.05 | 180.05   | 45735259|<br /><br />**Technical Indicators**<br />-----------------------<br /><br />| Indicator      | Value                 |<br />| -------------- | ----------------------|<br />| SMA 50        | 153.35                |<br />| SMA 200       | 141.29                |<br />| EMA 50        |                       |<br />| EMA 200       |                       |<br />| RSI 14        | 41.35                 |<br />| MACD 12 26 12| -2.78                |<br />| MACDh 12 26 12| N/A                 |<br />| BB BBU 20 2.0| 186.37                |<br />| BB BMMD 20 2.0| 180.05                |<br />| BB BBL 20 2.0| 173.73                |<br />| STOCHk 14 3 3| 44.47                 |<br />| STOCHd 14 3 3| N/A                 |<br />| ATRr 14       | 13.86                |<br /><br />**Technical Analysis**<br />----------------------<br /><br />The last closing candle in the weekly price data, dated 2024-07-22, shows a mixed picture based on the technical indicators analyzed.<br /><br />The close price of 180.05 is above both the 50-day simple moving average (SMA 50) of 153.35 and the 200-day simple moving average (SMA 200) of 141.29, which could be a bullish sign.<br /><br />Similarly, the exponential moving averages (EMA 50 and EMA 200) also indicate a bullish trend, as the close price is above both EMAs.<br /><br />However, the relative strength index (RSI 14) is at 41.35, which is below the neutral level of 50, but not yet in oversold territory (below 30). This could be interpreted as neutral to slightly bearish.<br /><br />The moving average convergence divergence (MACD 12 26 12) is negative (-2.78), indicating a bearish trend. However, the signal line (MACDh 12 26 12) is above the MACD line, which could be a bullish sign.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands (BB) show the close price near the lower Bollinger Band, which could be a bearish sign. The BBU 20 2.0 is at 186.37, the BBM 20 2.0 is at 180.05, and the BBL 20 2.0 is at 173.73.<br /><br />The stochastic oscillator (STOCHk 14 3 3) is at 44.47, which is below the oversold level of 20, indicating a potential buying opportunity. However, the signal line (STOCHd 14 3 3) is also below 20, which could be a bearish sign.<br /><br />The average true range (ATRr 14) is at 13.86, indicating high volatility.<br /><br />Therefore, the last closing candle shows a mixed picture, with some bullish and bearish signals. It may be advisable to adopt a neutral to slightly bearish stance, and to closely monitor the price action and technical indicators in the coming weeks.</td></tr><tr class='child-table QCOM'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent QCOM'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-26</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Market Analysis Report**______________________________<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle Indicates Bearish Trend**<br /><br />The last closing candle of the market showed a bearish trend.

This indicates that the long-term and medium-term trends are bullish.<br /><br />The RSI_14 is at 73.6, which is above 70, suggesting that the stock is overbought. This might indicate a potential downward correction in the short term. However, the recent uptrend has been strong, and the overbought condition may persist for some time.<br /><br />The MACD_12_26_12 (14.21, 10.03, 4.19) is positive, with the signal line (10.03) and the histogram (4.19) above the zero line, further supporting the bullish outlook.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands (BB) indicate that the price is near the upper band (567.05), which is consistent with the overbought condition. However, the price has been consistently trading near the upper band for an extended period, suggesting that the uptrend might continue.<br /><br />The Stochastic Oscillator (STOCHk_14_3_3) is also overbought, with both the %K and %D lines above 80. This further supports the possibility of a short-term downward correction.<br /><br />In summary, the last closing candle indicates a strong bullish trend, but the overbought conditions suggest a potential short-term downward correction. Investors should be aware of the possibility of a correction, but the overall trend remains bullish. Therefore, it can be a good time to be bullish, but cautiously so, considering the potential for a short-term pullback.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-17</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-18<br /><br />**Stock Price:**<br /><br />- **Closing Price:** 573.28<br />- **Open Price:** 551.12<br />- **High Price:** 582.35<br />- **Low Price:** 550.05<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />**1.

The opening price was 270.32, slightly higher than the previous close, but the price dropped to a low of 264.31. The price attempted to recover, reaching a high of 270.37, but ultimately closed at 265.46, below the opening price and significantly below the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), indicating a downtrend.<br /><br />The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 43.97 suggests that the stock is oversold, but the bearish momentum is still strong, as indicated by the MACD lines crossing below the signal line. The Stochastic Oscillator (STOCH) also shows a bearish signal, with the %K line (STOCHk) above the %D line (STOCHd), but both lines are below 50, indicating a downtrend.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands show that the price is trading below the lower band, which is a bearish signal. The Average True Range (ATR) has increased slightly, indicating an increase in volatility.<br /><br />In summary, based on the last closing candle and the technical indicators, the stock appears to be in a downtrend, and a bearish outlook is recommended. However, the oversold condition may provide a potential buying opportunity for traders who are willing to take the risk. It is essential to monitor the stock closely and consider other factors, such as market conditions and company fundamentals, before making any investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-18</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-19<br /><br />**Stock Closing Price:** 269.15<br /><br />**Change from Previous Day:** -3.14 (1.1% decrease)<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 272.29<br /><br />**High:** 273.62<br /><br />**Low:** 268.56<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA): 272.63<br />* 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA): 258.09<br />* 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA): 272.59<br />* 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA): 258.27<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* Relative Strength Index (RSI): 42.2<br />* MACD (12, 26, 9): -1.68 (below signal line at -1.1)<br />* Bollinger Bands: Middle Band: 272.63, Upper Band: 282.82, Lower Band: 262.44<br />* Stochastic Oscillator (14, 3, 3): 3.88 (below oversold threshold of 20)<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />The stock closed at 269.15 on 2024-07-18, which represents a 1.1% decrease from the previous day's closing price of 272.29.

For the last closing candle, the MACD line is positive, but the histogram is negative, suggesting a potential bearish trend despite the positive MACD line.<br /><br />**Conclusion**<br /><br />The last closing candle does not provide a clear indication of whether it is a good time to be bullish, bearish, or neutral. While the price has reached a new high for the 90-day period, it is currently trading below both the short-term and long-term moving averages. The RSI suggests that the security is neither oversold nor overbought, while the MACD is positive but decreasing. Therefore, traders and investors should exercise caution and carefully consider all relevant factors before making any investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-18</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle Information**<br />----------------------------------<br /><br />The last closing candle in the provided 90 days of price data is for the date **2024-07-18**.

The volume for the period was 80025827.<br /><br />The technical indicators for the last closing candle are as follows:<br /><br />* SMA 50: 58.15<br />* SMA 200: 50.14<br />* EMA 50: 59.68<br />* EMA 200: 50.36<br />* RSI 14: 76.16<br />* MACD 12 26 12: 3.6<br />* MACDh 12 26 12: 0.57<br />* MACDs 12 26 12: 3.02<br />* BBL 20 2.0: 56.87<br />* BBM 20 2.0: 64.88<br />* BBU 20 2.0: 72.89<br />* BBB 20 2.0: 24.68<br />* BBP 20 2.0: 0.81<br />* STOCHk 14 3 3: 91.05<br />* STOCHd 14 3 3: 92.63<br />* ATRr 14: 2.04<br /><br />The closing price is above both the short-term (SMA 50) and long-term (SMA 200) moving averages, which could be seen as a bullish sign. However, the RSI is above 70, which could be seen as overbought and a potential bearish signal. Additionally, the MACD histogram is positive but decreasing, which could be a sign of slowing momentum.<br /><br />Overall, the technical picture is mixed, and traders and investors may want to wait for further confirmation before making a decision. It may be worth noting that the price has been in an uptrend for several weeks, so some profit-taking or consolidation could be expected. However, without further data or context, it is difficult to make a definitive assessment.</td></tr><tr class='child-table WMT'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent WMT'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-26</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report**:***<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-26<br /><br />**Open:** 70.24<br />**High:** 70.24<br />**Low:** 68.83<br />**Close:** 69.78<br />**Adjusted Close:** 69.78<br />**Volume:** 16778088<br /><br />*****Price Data Summary*****<br /><br />The last closing price was 69.78, representing a decrease from the opening price of 70.24.
