The Bollinger Bands are also expanding, which could indicate a potential increase in volatility.<br /><br />Therefore, it is recommended to wait for further confirmation before making any trading decisions. A conservative approach would be to wait for a clear break of the support or resistance levels before entering any trades.

This could be a bearish signal, as the stock may be due for a correction.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle indicated a bearish signal, as the stock closed lower than its opening price. However, there were some bullish signals, such as the stock trading above both SMAs and the MACD line being above the signal line. Additionally, there were bearish signals, such as the stock being oversold and trading below the middle Bollinger Band.

However, the bullish sentiment is not particularly strong as the Close price is only slightly above the Open price and the range of the candle is relatively small compared to some other candles in the dataset.<br /><br />The volume for this candle is slightly above average for the dataset, which suggests that there may be some strength behind the bullish move.<br /><br />The 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is above the 200-day SMA, which is a bullish signal. However, the Close price is below both SMAs, which may indicate some resistance to further upward movement.<br /><br />The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for this candle is in neutral territory, and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is also in neutral territory.<br /><br />Based on the technical indicators and the data provided, the last closing candle does not provide a clear indication of whether to be bullish or bearish. The bullish sentiment of the candle is somewhat tempered by the fact that the Close price is below both SMAs and the RSI is in neutral territory. However, the slightly above-average volume and the fact that the 50-day SMA is above the 200-day SMA suggest that there may still be some upside potential. Therefore, a neutral stance may be appropriate at this time.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-06</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle**<br />---------------------<br /><br />The last closing candle in the provided 90 days of price data is for the date **2024-06-06**.

It is recommended to wait for further confirmation of a trend before making a decision.</td></tr><tr class='child-table JNJ'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent JNJ'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-14</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Market Analysis Report**---------------<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-06-14<br /><br />**Market Close:** 145.5399932861328<br /><br />**Percentage Change from Previous Day:** -0.63%<br /><br />**Low for the Day:** 144.47999572753906<br /><br />**High for the Day:** 145.97000122070312<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 145.07000732421875<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 40.65100900871489<br />* **50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA):** 159.55559936523437<br />* **200-day SMA:** 159.5536501312256<br />* **50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA):** 158.95162682179546<br />* **200-day EMA:** 159.38302827933478<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />* **Current Price:** Near lower end of bands<br />* **Bollinger Band Width:** 3.8282879322930374<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />* **Indicator:** -0.41069296807599004<br />* **Signal Line:** -0.3890697856287896<br />* **Histogram:** -0.021623182447200406<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />The stock closed at a lower price on 2024-06-14 compared to the previous day.

However, the price is still below the Simple Moving Average (SMA) for both the short-term (SMA_50) and long-term (SMA_200), which are at 159.545150 and 159.553650, respectively.<br /><br />The Relative Strength Index (RSI_14) is at 44.73, which is in the neutral zone. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators are positive, with MACD_12_26_12 at 0.3025, MACDh_12_26_12 at -0.1789, and MACDs_12_26_12 at 0.4814. This suggests a potential bullish trend.<br /><br />The price is near the lower Bollinger Band (BBL_20_2.0) at 156.75, indicating a possible oversold condition. The Stochastic Oscillator (STOCHk_14_3_3) and Stochastic %D (STOCHd_14_3_3) are both below 50, suggesting a potential bearish trend.<br /><br />In summary, the closing price on _2024-06-13_ does not provide a clear indication of whether to be bullish, bearish, or neutral. The positive MACD indicators suggest a potential bullish trend, but the STOCH indicators and the price's position near the lower Bollinger Band suggest a possible bearish trend. Investors should consider additional factors and indicators before making a decision.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-12</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Technical Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-06-12<br /><br />**Price Data:**<br />- Open: 147.05999755859375<br />- High: 147.2100067138672<br />- Low: 144.77999877929688<br />- Close: 145.41000366210938<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />**Bearish Candle:** The last closing candle is a bearish candle as the close is lower than the open.<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br />- 50-day SMA: 159.0762276724557<br />- 200-day SMA: 159.4217461841038<br /><br />Both the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA) are above the current price, which is a bearish sign.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** The RSI is 47.97437898958807, which is close to the neutral zone (50).<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** The MACD lines are negative, with the MACD line (-0.5139625729855177) below the signal line (0.5120643068946151).<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:** The price is within the Bollinger Bands, but the lower band is slightly narrowing, indicating decreasing volatility.<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator (STOCH):** The STOCH lines are below the oversold level (20), with the %K line (2.1595872031757293) below the %D line (2.1560453036882885).<br /><br />**Conclusion:** Based on the technical analysis of the provided price data, the last closing candle and various technical indicators suggest a bearish outlook for this stock.

The MACD histogram is currently at -0.69, and the Bollinger Bands are narrow, with the upper band at $207.64, the middle band at $193.78, and the lower band at $179.93.<br /><br />The ATR of 18.73 indicates high volatility, which should be taken into consideration when making investment decisions.<br /><br />It is recommended to exercise caution and closely monitor the stock's performance before making any investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='child-table JPM'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent JPM'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-14</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-06-14<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle:** 193.77999877929688<br /><br />**Percentage Change from Previous Day:** -1.92%<br /><br />**Volume:** 6,599,331<br /><br />**Average Volume (90 days):** 5,362,622<br /><br />**50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA):** 191.5590720741473<br /><br />**200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA):** 160.156518345342<br /><br />**50-day and 200-day SMA Trend:** Bullish<br /><br />**14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 42.32<br /><br />**RSI Territory:** Neutral<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** Bearish<br /><br />**MACD Line:** Below Signal Line<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:** Narrowing<br /><br />**Short-Term Market Trend:** Neutral to bearish<br /><br />**Long-Term Market Trend:** Bullish<br /><br />**Important Note:** This analysis is based solely on the data provided and should not be used as the sole basis for any investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-13</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Report**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-06-13<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle:**<br /><br />* Open price: 192.32000732421875<br />* High price: 194.5800018310547<br />* Low price: 190.88999938964844<br />* Close price: 193.58999633789062<br /><br />**Volume:** 6,491,786<br /><br />**Average Volumes:**<br /><br />* 90-day average volume: N/A<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA): 178.6080136419856<br />* 200-day SMA: 159.8298501512036<br />* 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA): 178.6080136419856<br />* 200-day EMA: 159.8298501512036<br />* Relative Strength Index (RSI): 54.67<br />* Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): Positive<br />* MACD line: 0.21788687771859036<br />* Signal line: 0.00433425459529472<br />* Bollinger Bands:<br />	+ Upper band: 194.87719970703125<br />	+ Middle band: 192.85668886977788<br />	+ Lower band: 190.83611916327816<br />* Stochastic Oscillator: 50.00<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />* The last closing candle indicates a slightly bullish trend, with the closing price higher than the opening price and above the 50-day and 200-day SMAs.<br />* The positive MACD and neutral RSI and Stochastic Oscillator also support this bullish trend.<br />* The volume for this candle was slightly above the 90-day average volume.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />Based on the provided analysis, the last closing candle indicates a slightly bullish trend in the stock market.

The MACD indicators were positive, with the MACD line at 20.491 and the signal line at 0.644, suggesting an uptrend. The Bollinger Bands showed that the last closing price was near the upper band, indicating that the stock was trading near the high end of its recent range.

Overall, the stock's price action did not necessarily indicate a good time to be bullish or bearish. The stock was trading near the high end of its recent range, and the MACD and RSI indicators suggested an uptrend. However, the stochastic oscillator and the high bandwidth of the Bollinger Bands suggested that the stock may be overextended and due for a correction.

The Bollinger Bands are relatively tight, with the upper band at 299.5101807728081, the middle band at 253.6999969482422, and the lower band at 207.88980102539062.<br /><br />Based on this analysis, it is difficult to make a clear determination about whether it is a good time to be bullish, bearish, or neutral. The slightly bullish candle and the neutral RSI and MACD suggest that there is no clear trend at the moment. The tight Bollinger Bands also suggest that the stock is trading within a narrow range and may be due for a breakout. However, it is important to consider the broader context of the price data and to consult other indicators and sources of information before making a decision.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-12</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle**<br />---------------------<br /><br />The last closing candle in the provided 90 days of price data is for the trading day of **2024-06-12**.

Analysis<br /><br />The last closing candle indicates a slightly bullish trend, as the Close price is higher than the Open price and is near the High price for the period. The RSI 14 value of 53.44235324859619 suggests that the stock is not overbought or oversold. The MACD indicators show a slight positive momentum. However, the STOCHk 14 3 3 value of 55.55555820465088 is relatively close to the overbought threshold of 80, which might indicate a potential reversal in the short term.<br /><br />In summary, the last closing candle suggests a slightly bullish trend, but investors should be cautious due to the high STOCHk 14 3 3 value and consider taking a neutral or slightly bearish stance in the short term. Long-term investors may find this a good opportunity to accumulate shares, given the overall uptrend and the RSI 14 and MACD indicators.</td></tr><tr class='child-table META'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent META'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-14</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report**:** Stock Market Trends<br /><br />**Date of Last Closing Candle:** 2024-06-14<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 504.1600036621094<br /><br />**Open Price:** 502.6499938964844<br /><br />**High:** 507.14990234375<br /><br />**Low:** 500.75<br /><br />**Volume:** 9985200<br /><br />**50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA):** 10436640<br /><br />**200-day SMA:** 11711100<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 58.321318671859274<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />* MACD Line (12-26-12): 0.032151<br />* Signal Line (9-day EMA of MACD Line): 0.018525<br />* Histogram: 0.013626<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />* Upper Band: 515.53<br />* Middle Band: 504.16<br />* Lower Band: 492.79<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:**<br /><br />* %K: 0.8353<br />* %D: 0.8635<br /><br />**Trend Indicators:**<br /><br />* The last closing candle indicates a bullish outlook for the stock.<br />* The close is near the upper Bollinger Band, which is a bullish sign.<br />* The MACD line is above the signal line, indicating a bullish trend.<br /><br />**Volume Indicators:**<br /><br />* The trading volume for the last candle was lower than the 50-day SMA and significantly below the 200-day SMA.<br /><br />**Oscillator Indicators:**<br /><br />* The RSI is in the neutral zone, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.<br />* The stochastic oscillator is in the overbought zone, suggesting that a correction may be due.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle suggests a bullish outlook for the stock, but the lower trading volume and overbought stochastic oscillator indicate that a correction may be due.

This candle has a small real body and a long upper wick, indicating increased selling pressure. The volume for this candle was significantly higher than previous candles.<br /><br />The 50-day SMA is 120.53339935302735, and the 200-day SMA is 114.47749965667725. The close of the last candle is above both the 50-day and 200-day SMAs, which is typically a bullish sign. However, the long upper wick and high volume suggest that the bullish trend may be coming to an end.<br /><br />The RSI for the last candle is 72.19754216851985, which is above the overbought threshold of 70. This indicates that the stock may be overbought and due for a correction. The MACD is also bullish, with the 12-day EMA above the 26-day EMA and the MACD histogram above the signal line. However, the MACD lines have begun to flatten, which may indicate a slowing of the uptrend.<br /><br />In summary, the last closing candle suggests a potential bearish reversal, with increased selling pressure and a long upper wick. However, the close above the 50-day and 200-day SMAs and the bullish MACD are still bullish indicators. Therefore, it may be wise to adopt a neutral stance and wait for further confirmation of the trend direction. A continuation of the uptrend would require a break above the high of the last candle, while a bearish reversal would be confirmed by a break below the low of the last candle.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-11</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 24-06-11<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 123.88999938964844<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 124.05000305175781<br /><br />**High:** 124.83000183105469<br /><br />**Low:** 122.29000091552734<br /><br />**Volume:** 1,047,3971<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| **Indicator** | **Value** |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| 50-day SMA | 112.85280023696295 |<br />| 200-day SMA | 108.42224575209003 |<br />| RSI | 69.18697742021958 |<br />| MACD Line | 2.235322777161016 |<br />| Signal Line | 1.4703407741357533 |<br />| Upper Bollinger Band | 105.74280082835665 |<br />| Middle Bollinger Band | 115.10944166329872 |<br />| Lower Bollinger Band | 124.4760824982408 |<br />| %K Line | 3.304425255446616 |<br />| %D Line | 3.2726806379398266 |<br />| Slow %D Line | 3.191644004281212 |<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />The last closing candle for the 90-day price data from the daily chart on 2024-06-11 exhibits a bullish sentiment.

The stock is in an overall uptrend, but it has been trading within a tight range in recent days. The RSI, MACD, and stochastic oscillator are all in the neutral range, suggesting that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.

The MACD indicators are bullish, but the Stochastic Oscillator is not extremely high, so it does not necessarily indicate an overbought condition. The ATRr_14 is relatively high, indicating high volatility. Therefore, it may be prudent to wait for further price action before making a decision.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-05</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle Values**<br />----------------------------<br /><br />Open: 247.94000244140625<br />High: 251.47999572753906<br />Low: 242.82000732421875<br />Close: 244.32000732421875<br /><br />**Volume**<br />--------<br /><br />347400<br /><br />**Moving Averages**<br />------------------<br /><br />50-day SMA: 220.11339969482422<br />200-day SMA: 185.4235994720459<br /><br />50-day EMA: 217.854599609375<br />200-day EMA: 184.90524940490724<br /><br />**Technical Indicators**<br />-----------------------<br /><br />14-day RSI: 45.12289180349798<br />50-day EMA (MACD): 10.68847925989678<br />200-day EMA (MACD): 0.7464333654385946<br />MACD Line: 10.68847925989678<br />Signal Line: 0.7464333654385946<br />Histogram: 9.942045894458186<br /><br />Bollinger Bands<br />--------------<br /><br />Upper Band (BBU): 251.59729759180635<br />Band (BBM): 234.78849523174682<br />Lower Band (BBB): 217.59729759180635<br />Band Width (BBP): 34.20000076293945<br /><br />Stochastic Oscillator<br />---------------------<br /><br />K: 89.84427832755092<br />D: 91.6742052850088<br /><br />**14-day Average True Range (ATR)**<br />----------------------------------<br /><br />4.122891803497984<br /><br />**Observations**<br />--------------<br /><br />The last closing candle is a bearish candle, as the closing price is lower than the opening price.

This bullish sign suggests that buyers were more aggressive than sellers during the trading session.<br /><br />**High and Low Prices:** The high price for the last candle was the same as the open and close price, at **599.030029296875**. The low price was **591.0399780273438**. The small real body in the candlestick chart indicates indecision in the market, but the higher high price suggests that buyers remain in control.<br /><br />**Moving Averages:** The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) was **556.9485998535156**, and the 200-day SMA was **529.5327531823114**.

The higher close price, higher high price, and the stock price being above both short-term and long-term moving averages are all positive signs. However, the RSI being above 50 and the MACD histogram being positive indicate that the stock is overbought, which should be monitored for potential signs of a trend reversal. Overall, a bullish stance is recommended.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr class='parent-row buy sell_daily' id='TSLA'><td>TSLA</td><td>Tesla Inc.

The candle's body is relatively large, indicating strong buying pressure. The High price is also significantly higher than the Close price, suggesting that there may have been some profit-taking or selling pressure near the end of the period. However, the fact that the Close price is near the top of the candle's range is still a positive sign for the stock.<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />- 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA): 202.00880004882814<br />- 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA): 234.7904997253418<br />- 12-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA): 202.57505404514328<br />- 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA): 221.18713484738166<br /><br />The Close price is below both the 50-day and 200-day SMAs, indicating that the stock may be in a longer-term downtrend.<br /><br />**Oscillators:**<br /><br />- 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI): 33.64258702861191<br />- 12-26-12 MACD: -5.870811886771179<br /><br />The RSI is below the 50 level, indicating that the stock may be oversold.

The Close price is currently near the lower Bollinger Band, which could be a sign of oversold conditions.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle is a bullish candle, but the stock is currently in a longer-term downtrend, as evidenced by its position below both the 50-day and 200-day SMAs. However, the stock's RSI and MACD are both indicating oversold conditions, which could potentially provide an opportunity for buyers to enter the market.

This indicates that despite some selling pressure during the day, the bulls managed to push the price up significantly by the end of the day. The close is above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which are currently at 515.2036016845703 and 512.3807875963652, respectively. This is a bullish sign, as it shows that the market is in an uptrend.<br /><br />However, there are some short-term bearish signals. The RSI is in neutral territory, but the MACD is negative, with the MACD line below the signal line. The Bollinger Bands and Stochastic Oscillator also indicate that the stock is overbought. These signals suggest that there may be some short-term bearish momentum, but the overall trend is still bullish. Therefore, it may be a good time to be bullish on this stock, but investors should keep an eye on the short-term bearish signals and be prepared for a potential correction.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr class='parent-row buy buy_daily' id='V'><td>V</td><td>Visa Inc.</td><td>2024-06-14</td><td>bullish</td></tr><tr class='explanation-table V'><td colspan='4'>**Weekly Stock Market Analysis Report**<br /><br />**Week Ending: 2024-06-10**<br /><br />**Price Data:**<br /><br />| Metric          | Value                                          |<br />|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|<br />| Open             | 278.1400146484375                                |<br />| High             | 278.55999755859375                                |<br />| Low              | 269.2699890136719                                |<br />| Close            | 270.6600036621094                                |<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| Indicator        | Value                                          |<br />|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|<br />| 50-day SMA        | 258.19780029296875                                |<br />| 200-day SMA       | 204.1129000854492                                |<br />| RSI              | 45.64161888497538                                |<br />| MACD             | -4.197476494837818                                |<br />| Bollinger Bands  | Within bands                                     |<br />| Stochastic Osc.  | 0.631151117364836                                |<br /><br />**Analysis:**<br /><br />The last closing candle shows a bearish signal as the close is lower than the open. However, some technical indicators suggest a potential buying opportunity. The 50-day SMA is above the 200-day SMA, which is typically a bullish signal. The stock is currently trading within the Bollinger Bands, indicating low volatility. The stock is near the lower Bollinger Band, which may represent a buying opportunity.<br /><br />However, other technical indicators, such as the MACD and Stochastic Oscillator, indicate a bearish signal. The MACD line is below the signal line, and the Stochastic Oscillator is above the overbought level of 80.<br /><br />Therefore, it may be wise to adopt a neutral to slightly bearish stance until further clarification.</td></tr><tr class='child-table V'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent V'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-14</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Technical Analysis Report**__________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-06-14<br /><br />**Open:** 270.1000061035156<br /><br />**High:** 271.54998779296875<br /><br />**Low:** 269.2699890136719<br /><br />**Close:** 270.6600036621094<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* The close price is slightly higher than the open price, indicating a bullish trend.<br />* The price range for the day was relatively narrow, with a high-low range of 2.28 points.<br />* The close price is above both the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of 270.0976 and the 200-day SMA of 253.86076, indicating a positive short-term and long-term trend.<br />* The relative strength index (RSI) is 59.32465, which is slightly above the neutral level of 50, indicating a slightly bullish momentum.<br />* The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is slightly bullish, with the MACD line (12-26-12) above the signal line, indicating a potential upward trend.<br />* The close price is near the upper Bollinger Band (20, 2.0), indicating that the price may be overbought and due for a correction.<br />* The stochastic oscillator (14, 3, 3) is also near the overbought level of 80, further supporting the possibility of a short-term correction.<br /><br />**Recommendation:**<br /><br />Based on the above technical analysis, the last closing candle suggests a slightly bullish trend, but the narrow price range and overbought indicators suggest that a short-term correction may be due.

This represents a slight decrease from the previous week's close of 58.45000076293945, indicating a potential downward trend. However, the closing price remains above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of 49.254799880981444 and the 200-day SMA of 46.21563402065295, which is a bullish sign.<br /><br />The relative strength index (RSI) for the last candle is 54.92418139317733, which is in the neutral range, neither overbought nor oversold.

Therefore, it may be a good time to be neutral or slightly bullish on the stock, but it is important to monitor the stock's performance in the coming weeks to confirm the trend.</td></tr><tr class='child-table WFC'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent WFC'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-14</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report**:***<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle:** The last closing candle in the provided 90 days of price data is for the trading day of *2024-06-14*.
