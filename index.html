This represents a bearish signal, as the price closed lower than it opened. The volume for the day was also relatively high at 61877900, which may indicate increased selling pressure.<br /><br />The short-term moving averages (SMA_50 and EMA_50) are both above the price, which is another bearish signal. The long-term moving averages (SMA_200 and EMA_200) are both below the price, but they are still quite far away, so they are not providing a clear directional signal.<br /><br />The RSI_14 is at 48.52, which is in neutral territory and does not provide a clear directional signal. The MACD indicators are also mixed, with the MACD line (MACD_12_26_12) above the signal line (MACDh_12_26_12), but the histogram (MACDs_12_26_12) is negative, indicating a bearish trend.<br /><br />Overall, the last closing candle suggests that the market is in a downtrend, with the price closing lower than it opened and the short-term moving averages above the price. However, the long-term moving averages are still below the price, and the RSI and MACD indicators are mixed, so it may be worth waiting for further confirmation before making any trading decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-31</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Data:** 2024-07-31<br />----------------------------------<br /><br />**Price Data:**<br />---------------<br /><br />| **Metric** | **Value** |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| Open | 221.53 |<br />| High | 223.82 |<br />| Low | 220.64 |<br />| Close | 222.81 |<br />| Adj Close | 222.81 |<br />| Volume | 32575710 |<br /><br />**Comparison with Previous Candle:**<br />------------------------------------<br /><br />The last closing candle has a slightly higher open price and reached a high of 223.82, but closed slightly lower at 222.81.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI_14) is at 55.27, which is in the neutral zone, neither overbought nor oversold. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators show a positive MACD line, but the signal line is crossing below the MACD line, which could be a bearish signal. The Bollinger Bands (BBL_20_2.0, BBM_20_2.0, BBU_20_2.0, BBB_20_2.0, and BBP_20_2.0) show that the price is near the upper band, indicating that the price might correct downwards. The Stochastic indicators (STOCHk_14_3_3 and STOCHd_14_3_3) are in the overbought zone, suggesting that the price might correct downwards. The Average True Range (ATRr_14) indicator shows a high level of volatility.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br />--------------<br /><br />The last closing candle shows a slightly lower closing price compared to the high of the day, with lower volume. The technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish outlook, with the price near the upper Bollinger Band and Stochastic indicators in the overbought zone. However, the SMA and EMA indicators show an uptrend.

The short-term moving averages are above the long-term moving averages, and the stock is currently trading near the lower Bollinger Band, which could be bullish signs. However, the MACD and Stochastic indicators suggest that the stock may be experiencing a bearish signal in the short term.

The price opened slightly higher than the previous close but then dropped and fluctuated throughout the day before closing slightly lower than the open. The volume for this candle is also lower than the previous day.<br /><br />The short-term moving averages (SMA_50 and EMA_50) are both above the price, indicating a downtrend in the short term. However, the long-term moving averages (SMA_200 and EMA_200) are both below the price, indicating an overall uptrend in the long term.<br /><br />The RSI is at 46.14, which is in neutral territory and does not indicate overbought or oversold conditions. The MACD is slightly negative, but not significantly, indicating a weak downtrend.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands are relatively wide, indicating high volatility. The price is currently near the lower Bollinger Band, which could indicate a buying opportunity. However, the STOCHastic oscillator is currently above 80, indicating overbought conditions, which could suggest caution for buyers.<br /><br />Overall, the last closing candle does not provide a clear signal for traders and investors. The short-term downtrend is not supported by the long-term uptrend, and the indicators are mixed. Therefore, a neutral or cautious approach may be appropriate.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-25</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 220.92 (2024-07-25)<br /><br />**Price Change:** Slight increase from the open price of 217.3<br /><br />**Trading Volume:** 5,098,611, above the average volume<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| **Indicator**          | **Value**          |<br />|-----------------------|-------------------|<br />| 50-day SMA             | 230.65            |<br />| 200-day SMA            | 198.74            |<br />| 50-day EMA            | 230.4             |<br />| 200-day EMA            | 198.5             |<br />| Current Price vs 50-day SMA | Below             |<br />| Current Price vs 200-day SMA | Below             |<br />| RSI                   | 41.06             |<br />| MACD (12, 26, 12)     | -1.99             |<br />| Bollinger Bands        | Below lower band  |<br />| Stochastic Oscillator | 2.01              |<br /><br />**Trend Analysis:**<br /><br />The stock is currently trading below both the 50 and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), indicating a bearish trend.

The technical indicators for this candle are as follows:<br /><br />* The Simple Moving Average (SMA) for the 50-day period was 229.54, and the 200-day SMA was 197.96.<br />* The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for the 50-day period was also 229.54, and the 200-day EMA was 197.96.<br />* The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for the 14-day period was 43.62.<br />* The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) lines were 1.1, 2.37, and -1.28 for the 12-day, 26-day, and 9-day periods, respectively.<br />* The Bollinger Bands (BB) values for the 20-day period were 222.62 (Lower Band), 233.09 (Middle Band), and 243.56 (Upper Band).<br />* The Bollinger Bands Percentage (BBP) was -8.98.<br />* The Stochastic Oscillator (STOCH) values for the 14-day period were 22.62 (Fast K) and 34.19 (Slow D).<br />* The Average True Range (ATR) for the 14-day period was 47.4.<br /><br />Based on the last closing candle and the technical indicators, the current trend appears to be bearish. The price closed below the open, SMA_50, SMA_200, EMA_50, and EMA_200, indicating a downtrend. The RSI value of 43.62 suggests that the stock is oversold, but this is not enough to reverse the bearish trend. The MACD lines are positive, but the MACDs line is below the MACDh line, indicating a weak bullish signal. The BBP value of -8.98 is below the oversold threshold of -8%, indicating a strong bearish signal. The STOCH values are also below the oversold threshold of 20%, indicating a strong bearish signal. The ATR value of 47.4 suggests high volatility in the stock price.<br /><br />Therefore, it may be a good time to be bearish on this stock, but it is essential to consider other factors such as fundamental analysis and market conditions before making a trading decision.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-23</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Last Closing Data:** _2024-07-23_<br /><br />**Price Data:**<br /><br />| **Metric**          | **Value** |<br />|---------------------|-----------|<br />| Open                 | 234.1     |<br />| High                 | 236.92    |<br />| Low                  | 229.03    |<br />| Close                | 230.32    |<br />| Adj Close            | 230.32    |<br />| Volume              | 3697328   |<br /><br />**Price Change:**<br /><br />* Decrease from previous day's close: 9.72 points<br />* Percentage decrease: 4.05%<br /><br />**Comparison with Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* 50-day SMA: 230.05<br />* 200-day SMA: 198.24<br />* Close is above 50-day SMA but below 200-day SMA<br /><br />**Comparison with Exponential Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* 50-day EMA: 230.21<br />* 200-day EMA: 198.41<br />* Close is above 50-day EMA but below 200-day EMA<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** RSI-14: 47.91 (neutral)<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />* MACD line: -2.08<br />* Signal line: -1.42<br />* Bearish signal<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />* Upper band: 243.84<br />* Middle band (20-day SMA): 230.05<br />* Lower band: 216.26<br />* Close near lower band, indicating potential oversold condition<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:** Stochastic Oscillator-14, 3, 3: 3.31 (oversold)<br /><br />**Conclusion:** The last closing candle indicates a bearish trend, with the price dropping significantly from the previous day's close.

However, due to the overbought Stochastic Oscillator, it might be prudent to wait for a pullback before entering a long position. A buy entry could be considered if the price pulls back to a support level and the overall trend remains bullish.</td></tr><tr class='child-table AZN'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent AZN'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-08-02</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Daily Candle Report: 2024-08-02**<br /><br />**Candle Type:** Bullish Engulfing<br /><br />**Open:** 81.6<br />**High:** 82.01<br />**Low:** 80.83<br />**Close:** 81.81<br />**Adj Close:** 81.81<br />**Volume:** 7,065,900<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />- **SMA_50:** 78.71<br />- **SMA_200:** 70.09<br />- **EMA_50:** 77.95<br />- **EMA_200:** 72.57<br />- **RSI_14:** 65.15 (Neutral)<br />- **MACD_12_26_12:** 6.08 (Bullish)<br />- **MACDh_12_26_12:** 1.07 (Bullish)<br />- **MACDs_12_26_12:** 88.61 (Bullish)<br />- **BBL_20_2.0:** 72.57<br />- **BBM_20_2.0:** 79.26<br />- **BBU_20_2.0:** 85.95<br />- **BBB_20_2.0:** 75.35<br />- **BBP_20_2.0:** 78.35<br />- **STOCHk_14_3_3:** 91.96 (Overbought)<br />- **STOCHd_14_3_3:** 81.81 (Neutral)<br />- **ATRr_14:** 1.36 (Low Volatility)<br /><br />**Analysis:**<br /><br />- The last closing candle is a bullish engulfing pattern, indicating a potential trend reversal to the upside.<br />- The candle has a high RSI value (65.15), suggesting that the asset may be overbought in the short term.<br />- MACD indicators are bullish, with MACD_12_26_12 crossing above the signal line and MACDs_12_26_12 making a new high.<br />- Bollinger Bands are expanding, indicating increased volatility.

The 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA_50 and EMA_200) were 200.17 and 204.34.<br /><br />The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI_14) was 46.96, indicating that the stock was oversold.

The RSI_14 is below 50, indicating that the stock is oversold. However, the MACD histogram is showing a slight positive trend, which could indicate a potential reversal. The Bollinger Bands are also narrowing, which could suggest a breakout in the near future.<br /><br />Therefore, it may be a good time to be cautiously bullish, but it is essential to monitor the market closely for any signs of a reversal or breakout. It is also crucial to consider other market and economic factors before making any investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-26</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Data:** 2024-07-26<br /><br />| **Metric**          | **Value** |<br />|---------------------|-----------|<br />| Open Price          | 198.93    |<br />| High Price          | 201.49    |<br />| Low Price           | 198.93    |<br />| Close Price         | 200.54    |<br />| Adjusted Close Price| 200.54    |<br />| Volume             | 1,217,023 |<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />| **Moving Average** | **Value** |<br />|--------------------|-----------|<br />| SMA_50             | 200.4     |<br />| SMA_200            | 208.9     |<br />| EMA_50             | 200.35    |<br />| EMA_200            | 204.47    |<br /><br />**Indicators:**<br /><br />| **Indicator**      | **Value** |<br />|--------------------|-----------|<br />| RSI_14            | 55.68     |<br />| MACD_12_26_12    | -         |<br />| MACDh              | 0.1       |<br />| MACDs              | -0.77     |<br />| Bollinger Bands    | -         |<br />| BBL                | 193.55    |<br />| BBM                | 198.16    |<br />| BBU                | 202.77    |<br />| BBB                | 193.51    |<br />| Stochastic Oscillator| -         |<br />| STOCHk             | 98.16     |<br />| STOCHd             | 93.55     |<br />| ATRr_14           | 3.16      |<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />The last closing candle occurred on 2024-07-26, with a close price of 200.54.

The close price is higher than the open price, which could be interpreted as a bullish signal. However, the close price is also lower than the high price for the day, which could be interpreted as a bearish signal.<br /><br />The RSI_14 indicator is 66.08, which is close to the neutral value of 50. This suggests that the market is not overbought or oversold. The MACD indicators are also relatively flat, which supports the idea that the market is not showing a clear trend.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands (BBL, BBM, BBU, BBB, and BBP) are relatively wide, indicating that the market is volatile. The close price is near the lower Bollinger Band, which could be interpreted as a bearish signal. However, the distance between the close price and the lower Bollinger Band is not particularly large, so this signal should be interpreted with caution.<br /><br />The STOCH indicators are both above 80, which suggests that the market is overbought.

However, the stock is overbought, as indicated by the Bollinger Bands and the slow and fast stochastics. The MACD is also showing a bullish signal, but the price is trading below the SMA_200 and EMA_200, which could indicate a potential bearish trend in the long term.

The price reached a new high of 68.11 during the day but closed lower than the intraday high at 67.96. This forms a bearish reversal pattern, which might indicate weakening bullish momentum.<br /><br />**Moving Averages:** The SMA_50 is at 63.85, and the SMA_200 is at 60.48. The price is trading above both the SMA_50 and SMA_200, which is typically considered a bullish sign. However, the EMA_50 is at 64.13, and the EMA_200 is at 61.58.

This indicates that the price has experienced a strong upward movement.<br /><br />The Stochastic Oscillator (14, 3, 3) is at 96.73, which is above 80, indicating that the stock might be overbought.

However, the recent candle's wick and bearish MACD signals suggest caution. Consider taking profits on long positions or waiting for a pullback before entering new long positions.<br />- **Bearish:** The bearish MACD signals and overbought RSI and Stochastic Oscillator suggest that the uptrend may be losing momentum. Consider shorting the asset or putting stop-loss orders on long positions.<br />- **Neutral:** The price may consolidate or pull back in the short term due to overbought conditions and bearish MACD signals. Consider waiting for a clearer trend before entering new positions.<br /><br />**Potential Entry:**<br /><br />- **Buy:** If the price pulls back and finds support around the 200-day EMA (425.50) or the lower Bollinger Band (437.62), consider entering a long position with a stop-loss below the recent low (443.71).<br />- **Sell:** If the price breaks above the recent high (457.79) and the upper Bollinger Band (465.62), consider entering a short position with a stop-loss above the recent high.<br /><br />**Risk-Reward Ratio:** Aim for a 3:1 risk-reward ratio, meaning that for every dollar risked, aim to make at least three dollars in profit. For example, if entering a long position with a stop-loss at 443.71, aim to take profits at 460.53 (454.00 + 6.01 * 3).</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-08-01</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**__________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** (2024-08-01)<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 453.34<br /><br />**Open Price:** 456.07<br /><br />**High Price:** 459.47<br /><br />**Low Price:** 449.91<br /><br />**Trend Indicators:**<br /><br />* Close price higher than previous day's close and above SMA_50 and EMA_50: potential bullish trend.<br />* Close price slightly below SMA_200 and EMA_200: potential resistance level.<br />* RSI_14 above neutral level of 50: stock is overbought, potential correction in short term.<br /><br />**Moving Average Indicators:**<br /><br />* SMA_50: 438.84<br />* SMA_200: 426.96<br />* EMA_50: 438.43<br />* EMA_200: 425.22<br /><br />**Oscillator Indicators:**<br /><br />* MACD line above signal line: bullish trend.<br />* Stochastic Oscillator STOCHk above STOCHd: bullish trend.<br /><br />**Volatility Indicator:**<br /><br />* ATRr_14: 6.4<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />* BBL_20_2.0: 441.64<br />* BBU_20_2.0: 458.77<br />* Close price above BBU_20_2.0: strong bullish trend.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-31</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report (2024-07-31)***<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle:** The last closing candle was bullish with a higher close of 454.06 compared to the previous day's close.

The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA_50) was **864.49**, and the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA_200) was **730.25**. The 50-day SMA and 200-day SMA were both below the current price, indicating an upward trend. The 50-day EMA was also above the 200-day EMA, which is a bullish signal.<br /><br />**Technical Indicators**<br />------------------------<br /><br />The Relative Strength Index (RSI) value for the last closing candle was **46.38**, which is in the neutral range (below 50 and above 30). This suggests that the stock is not overbought or oversold at the moment.<br /><br />The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) values for the last closing candle were MACD_12_26_12 = **3.91**, MACDh_12_26_12 = **12.59**, and MACDs_12_26_12 = **-13.08**. The MACD line (MACD_12_26_12) was above the signal line (MACDs_12_26_12), indicating a bullish signal. However, the MACD histogram was negative, which suggests that the bullish signal may not be strong.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands values for the last closing candle were BBL_20_2.0 = **839.19**, BBM_20_2.0 = **895.57**, BBU_20_2.0 = **951.95**, and BBB_20_2.0 = **829.19**. The close price was near the upper Bollinger Band, which suggests that the stock may be overbought.<br /><br />The Stochastic Oscillator values for the last closing candle were STOCHk_14_3_3 = **23.63** and STOCHd_14_3_3 = **19.5**. The Stochastic Oscillator was in the oversold range (below 20), which suggests that the stock may be due for a rebound.<br /><br />The Average True Range (ATRr_14) value for the last closing candle was **23.73**, which is relatively high. This suggests that the stock has been experiencing high volatility recently.<br /><br />**Conclusion**<br />------------<br /><br />Based on the above analysis, the last closing candle suggests a neutral to slightly bullish outlook. The stock is not overbought or oversold, and the moving averages are indicating an upward trend. However, the MACD histogram is negative, and the Stochastic Oscillator is in the oversold range, which suggests that the bullish signal may not be strong. The high volatility also suggests that the stock may be risky. Therefore, investors and traders should exercise caution and consider their risk tolerance before making a decision.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr class='parent-row sell sell_daily' id='LRCX'><td>LRCX</td><td>Lam Research Corporation Common Stock</td><td>2024-08-02</td><td>bearish</td></tr><tr class='explanation-table LRCX'><td colspan='4'>**Report on the Last Closing Candle (2024-07-29)**<br /><br />**Candle Details:**<br /><br />- **Date:** 2024-07-29<br />- **Open:** 909.19<br />- **High:** 931.33<br />- **Low:** 758.00<br />- **Close:** 763.00<br />- **Volume:** 12,401,724<br /><br />**Candle Type:** Bullish Engulfing Pattern (Bearish engulfing the previous candle)<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />- **RSI (14):** 36.37 (Neutral, previously oversold)<br />- **MACD (12,26,9):** -4.8 (Bearish signal, previously bullish)<br />  - MACD Line: -4.8<br />  - Signal Line: 0.0<br />  - MACD Histogram: -4.8<br />- **Bollinger Bands (20,2.0):**<br />  - **BB Upper:** 832.47<br />  - **BB Middle:** 796.23<br />  - **BB Lower:** 759.99<br />- **Average True Range (ATR) (14):** 29.10<br /><br />**Entry Signal:**<br /><br />Given the bearish engulfing pattern and the recent change in RSI and MACD signals, there is a potential entry point for a sell order.

The bearish trend should be taken into account, but the oversold conditions might suggest a potential rebound.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr class='parent-row slight_buy sell_daily' id='MA'><td>MA</td><td>Mastercard Incorporated Common Stock</td><td>2024-08-02</td><td>slightly bullish</td></tr><tr class='explanation-table MA'><td colspan='4'>**Weekly Price Data Report: 2024-07-29**<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle:**<br /><br />- **Date:** 2024-07-29<br />- **Open:** 438.8<br />- **High:** 474.0<br />- **Low:** 435.42<br />- **Close:** 462.02<br />- **Adj Close:** 462.02<br />- **Volume:** 18317098<br /><br />**Technical Details:**<br /><br />- **SMA_50:** 431.58<br />- **SMA_200:** 373.34<br />- **EMA_50:** 433.57<br />- **EMA_200:** 374.49<br />- **RSI_14:** 43.81 (Neutral territory, slightly bullish)<br />- **MACD_12_26_12:** -0.61 (Bearish signal)<br />- **MACDh_12_26_12:** -0.61<br />- **MACDs_12_26_12:** -0.01<br />- **BBL_20_2.0:** 435.83<br />- **BBM_20_2.0:** 452.07<br />- **BBU_20_2.0:** 470.27<br />- **BBB_20_2.0:** 409.8<br />- **BBP_20_2.0:** 425.03<br />- **STOCHk_14_3_3:** 75.76 (Bullish signal)<br />- **STOCHd_14_3_3:** 75.76<br />- **ATRr_14:** 17.73<br /><br />**Entry Signal:**<br /><br />Based on the recent price action and technical indicators, a potential entry point for a long position has been identified:<br /><br />- **Entry Price:** 435.42 (Low of the last candle)<br />- **Stop Loss:** 428.8 (Below the recent low)<br />- **Take Profit:** 474.0 (Recent high)<br /><br />**Reasoning:**<br /><br />- The price has been in an uptrend since late 2023.<br />- The recent pullback found support around the 200-week SMA.<br />- RSI is in neutral territory, suggesting no immediate overbought or oversold conditions.<br />- STOCH is indicating a bullish signal, with the %K line crossing above 80.<br />- The entry price is below the 200-week SMA, which could act as dynamic support.<br />- The stop loss is placed below the recent low, aiming to limit potential losses if the price turns against the trade.<br />- The take profit is set at the recent high, aiming for a 3:1 risk-reward ratio.</td></tr><tr class='child-table MA'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent MA'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-08-02</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Daily Candle Report: 2024-08-02**<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle:**<br /><br />- **Date:** 2024-08-02<br />- **Open:** 460.22<br />- **High:** 466.75<br />- **Low:** 458.61<br />- **Close:** 462.02<br />- **Adj Close:** 461.97<br />- **Volume:** 3,807,700<br /><br />**Technical Details:**<br /><br />- **SMA_50:** 446.66<br />- **SMA_200:** 441.03<br />- **EMA_50:** 448.37<br />- **EMA_200:** 447.82<br />- **RSI_14:** 57.94 (Neutral territory, but trending down)<br />- **MACD_12_26_12:** -0.66 (Bearish signal, below zero line)<br />- **MACDh_12_26_12:** -0.66 (Bearish signal, below zero line)<br />- **MACDs_12_26_12:** -0.66 (Bearish signal, below zero line)<br />- **BBL_20_2.0:** 447.37<br />- **BBM_20_2.0:** 459.37<br />- **BBU_20_2.0:** 461.37<br />- **BBB_20_2.0:** 435.37<br />- **BBP_20_2.0:** 448.37<br />- **STOCHk_14_3_3:** 55.71 (Neutral territory, but trending down)<br />- **STOCHd_14_3_3:** 55.71 (Neutral territory, but trending down)<br />- **ATRr_14:** 4.57<br /><br />**Entry Signal:**<br /><br />Based on the last closing candle and the provided price data, there is a potential **SELL** signal with the following details:<br /><br />- **Entry Price:** 462.02 (Last closing price)<br />- **Stop Loss:** 464.50 (Above the recent high)<br />- **Take Profit:** 458.50 (Below the recent low, aiming for a 3:1 risk-reward ratio)<br /><br />**Reasoning:**<br /><br />- The price has been making higher highs and lower lows recently, indicating a bearish trend.<br />- The RSI is in neutral territory but trending down, suggesting that the price may be overbought.<br />- The MACD indicators are all below the zero line, providing a bearish signal.<br />- The price has broken below the upper Bollinger Band, which could indicate a potential reversal.<br /><br />**Disclaimer:** This report is based on the provided price data and does not take into account any fundamental or news-driven factors.

This means that for every $1 risked, $3 would be targeted as profit.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-08-01</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**---------------<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-08-01<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 268.75<br /><br />**Open:** 266.82<br /><br />**High:** 268.77<br /><br />**Low:** 262.4<br /><br />**Adjusted Close:** 268.75<br /><br />**Volume:** 4916300<br /><br />**Price Movement:**<br /><br />* The price opened higher than the previous day at 266.82.<br />* Reached a high of 268.77 during the trading session.<br />* Closed even higher at 268.75, indicating a bullish trend.<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* SMA_50: 256.15<br />* SMA_200: 274.78<br />* EMA_50: 259.09<br />* EMA_200: 270.41<br /><br />**Price in Relation to Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* The close for the day is above both the SMA_50 and EMA_50, which is a bullish sign.<br />* However, it is slightly below the SMA_200 and EMA_200, which could indicate a potential bearish reversal in the future.<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* RSI_14: 95.0<br />* MACD_12_26_12: 2.02<br />* MACDh_12_26_12: 2.18<br /><br />**RSI_14:**<br /><br />* The RSI_14 for the day is at an extremely high level of 95.0, indicating that the stock is overbought.<br /><br />**MACD Indicators:**<br /><br />* The MACD_12_26_12 is showing a positive value of 2.02, which is a bullish sign.<br />* However, the MACDh_12_26_12 is at a higher value of 2.18, indicating a potential bearish divergence.<br /><br />**Other Indicators:**<br /><br />* ATRr_14: 5.6<br /><br />**Volatility:**<br /><br />* The ATRr_14 for the day is at a relatively high level of 5.6, indicating that the stock has high volatility.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />* The last closing candle indicates a bullish trend for the day, with the price closing higher than the previous day.<br />* However, the RSI_14 and potential bearish divergence in the MACD indicators suggest that the stock may be overbought and could experience a bearish reversal in the short term.<br />* The high volatility indicated by the ATRr_14 also suggests that the stock is subject to large price swings.<br />* Investors and traders should exercise caution and consider these factors before making a decision.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-31</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Report**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Price Data**<br />--------------------------<br /><br />The last closing candle in the provided price data is for the date **2024-07-31**.

The open price was 69.05, and the high of the day was 69.63. The volume on this day was higher than the average, indicating increased selling pressure.<br /><br />The short-term moving averages (SMA_50 and EMA_50) were below the close price, while the long-term moving averages (SMA_200 and EMA_200) were above the close price. This suggests a bearish short-term outlook and a bullish long-term outlook.<br /><br />The RSI (14) was at 53.79, which is close to the neutral zone (50), indicating that the stock was neither overbought nor oversold. However, the MACD lines were positive, with the MACDh (0.34) above the MACDs (-0.22), which could indicate a potential bullish reversal in the near future.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands showed that the close price was near the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting that the stock was oversold. However, the bearish candle on this day contradicted this notion.<br /><br />The Stochastic Oscillator (STOCHk and STOCHd) was in the overbought zone, which was not in line with the bearish price action. This could be a sign of a potential bullish divergence.<br /><br />In summary, the last closing candle indicates a bearish short-term outlook due to the lower close compared to the previous day and higher volume. However, the long-term outlook remains bullish, and there are some signs of potential bullish reversal, such as the positive MACD lines and the potential bullish divergence in the Stochastic Oscillator.

The RSI value is slightly below the neutral level of 50, and the Stochastic Oscillator values are below the overbought level, suggesting that the market is not demonstrating strong bullish or bearish momentum. The MACD lines are negative, and the MACD histogram is below the zero line, indicating a bearish signal. The Close price is near the lower Bollinger Band, which is often seen as a bearish signal. The ATR value is relatively low, indicating that the market volatility is decreasing.<br /><br />Based on the analysis of the last closing candle and its relevant technical indicators, the market appears to be in a weak bearish phase. However, the RSI and Stochastic Oscillator values suggest that the market is not demonstrating strong bearish momentum either. Therefore, it might be a neutral or slightly bearish time to invest, and traders should be cautious and monitor the market closely for further developments.<br /><br />Please note that this analysis is based solely on historical price data and technical indicators, and it does not account for fundamental factors or future events that could impact the market.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr class='parent-row buy buy_daily' id='MELI'><td>MELI</td><td>MercadoLibre Inc.

However, given the lack of a clear entry signal, it is not recommended to enter a trade at this time.</td></tr><tr class='child-table MU'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent MU'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-08-02</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>Alright, here's the restructured stock market report based on the provided analysis:<br /><br />**Stock Market Report: 2024-08-02**<br /><br />**Open:** 97.16<br /><br />**High:** 97.69<br /><br />**Low:** 91.07<br /><br />**Close:** 92.7<br /><br />**Adj Close:** 92.7<br /><br />**Volume:** 35,994,700<br /><br />**SMA_50:** 127.77<br /><br />**SMA_200:** 91.22<br /><br />**EMA_50:** 128.32<br /><br />**EMA_200:** 91.56<br /><br />**RSI_14:** 31.95 (Neutral)<br /><br />**MACD_12_26_12:** -7.44 (Bearish signal)<br /><br />**MACDh_12_26_12:** -2.72 (Bearish signal)<br /><br />**MACDs_12_26_12:** -5.67 (Bearish signal)<br /><br />**BBL_20_2.0:** 90.08<br /><br />**BBM_20_2.0:** 114.19<br /><br />**BBU_20_2.0:** 138.3<br /><br />**BBB_20_2.0:** 42.23<br /><br />**BBP_20_2.0:** 10.52<br /><br />**STOCHk_14_3_3:** 10.52 (Oversold)<br /><br />**STOCHd_14_3_3:** 10.36 (Oversold)<br /><br />**ATRr_14:** 5.92<br /><br />**Candle Type:** The last closing candle is a bullish engulfing candle, as the close is higher than the open, and it has a lower low than the previous day's low.<br /><br />**Price Action:** The price has been in a downtrend since the peak on 2024-06-18. The last candle shows a potential reversal, as the price closed above the previous day's low.<br /><br />**Indicators:**<br /><br />* **RSI:** The RSI is in the neutral zone, indicating that the price is not overbought or oversold.<br />* **MACD:** The MACD is giving a bearish signal, as the MACD line has crossed below the signal line. However, the MACD histogram is showing a bullish divergence, as it is making higher lows while the price is making lower lows.<br />* **BBands:** The price is below the middle band (BBU), and the bands are widening, indicating increased volatility.<br />* **STOCH:** The STOCH is in oversold territory, suggesting that the price may be due for a bounce.<br /><br />**Support/Resistance:** The immediate support level is around 91.07 (today's low), and the immediate resistance level is around 97.69 (today's high). The 50-day SMA (127.77) and the 200-day SMA (91.22) are also key levels to watch.<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />1. The last closing candle is a bullish engulfing candle, which could indicate a potential reversal in the downtrend.<br />2. The price is currently in oversold territory, as indicated by the STOCH, which suggests a possible bounce.<br />3. The MACD histogram is showing a bullish divergence, which could also indicate a potential reversal.<br />4. The price is below the 50-day SMA and the 200-day SMA, which are key levels to watch for potential support or resistance.<br /><br />**Recommendation:**<br /><br />Given the bullish engulfing candle, the oversold STOCH, and the bullish divergence in the MACD histogram, there is a possibility that the price may bounce from the current level. However, the bearish MACD signal and the downtrend should be taken into consideration. A buy entry could be considered if the price breaks above the 50-day SMA or the previous high (97.69) with a stop loss placed below the recent low (91.07). A risk-reward ratio of 3:1 could be used, with the take profit level calculated as follows:<br /><br />* Take profit = Entry + (3 * (Entry - Stop Loss))<br /><br />**Example:**<br /><br />* Entry: 97.69<br />* Stop Loss: 91.07<br />* Take profit: 97.69 + (3 * (97.69 - 91.07)) = 105.77</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-08-01</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report******<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 101.51 (2024-08-01)<br /><br />**Price Data:**<br /><br />| **Metric** | **Value** |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| Open | 107.18 |<br />| High | 107.86 |<br />| Low | 99.95 |<br />| Close | 101.51 |<br />| Adj Close | 101.51 |<br />| Volume | 31564600 |<br />| SMA_50 | 128.47 |<br />| SMA_200 | 101.16 |<br />| EMA_50 | 122.31 |<br />| EMA_200 | 105.76 |<br />| RSI_14 | 31.95 |<br />| MACD_12_26_12 | -7.44 |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12 | -2.26 |<br />| MACDs_12_26_12 | -5.18 |<br />| BBL_20_2.0 | 94.34 |<br />| BBM_20_2.0 | 116.45 |<br />| BBU_20_2.0 | 138.56 |<br />| BBB_20_2.0 | 37.97 |<br />| BBP_20_2.0 | 0.16 |<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3 | 9.53 |<br />| STOCHd_14_3_3 | 9.52 |<br />| ATRr_14 | 5.57 |<br /><br />**Price Trend:** The last closing candle indicates a bearish trend.

This suggests that the price might be overstretched and due for a pullback.<br />- MACD_12_26_12 is positive and above zero, indicating bullish momentum.<br />- ATRr_14 is 6.46, which is relatively low, suggesting low volatility and a lack of significant price movements.<br /><br />**Entry Signal:**<br />Given the above observations, there is no clear entry signal for a buy or sell order based on the last closing candle alone. However, if you're looking for a buy entry, you might consider waiting for a pullback or a retest of the support level (e.g., SMA_50 or SMA_200) before entering a long position. For a sell entry, you would likely want to see a break below the SMA_50 or SMA_200 and a bearish reversal pattern.<br /><br />**Stop Loss and Take Profit:**<br />If you decide to enter a long position after a pullback or retest of the support level, you might place your stop loss below the recent low (e.g., below the low of the last candle or a swing low). For take profit, you could aim for a target price that is a multiple of the risk (e.g., 3 times the risk taken, given the 3:1 risk-reward ratio). For example, if you risk $100 on the trade, you might aim for a take profit of $300.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-08-01</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report** - 2024-08-01<br /><br />**Last Closing Price and Price Range:** The last closing price was 112.1, which was higher than the opening price of 112.0.

However, the bands have been narrowing, suggesting that volatility is decreasing.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle suggests that the stock may be due for a correction, as it has been trading downwards in recent days. However, the RSI and MACD indicators suggest that there is still some buying pressure and the short-term trend is still positive. Therefore, a neutral to slightly bearish stance may be appropriate at this time.

It's best to wait for a clearer trend or a reversal signal before making a decision.<br /><br />**Potential Entry:**<br /><br />If the price breaks below the recent low of 93.2, it could signal a continuation of the downtrend. In that case, a sell order could be placed with a stop loss above the recent high of 95.79 and a take profit level at a significant support level, such as 90.0.

The price closed below both the short-term and long-term moving averages, which can be considered bearish.<br />2. **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA):** EMA_50 = 104.54, EMA_200 = 103.1. Similar to SMA, the price closed below both the short-term and long-term moving averages, suggesting a bearish outlook.<br />3. **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** RSI_14 = 41.22. An RSI below 50 indicates that the stock is oversold, but it is not extremely low, so it does not necessarily indicate a strong buy signal.<br />4. **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** MACD_12_26_12 = -1.89, MACDh_12_26_12 = -0.76, MACDs_12_26_12 = -1.13.

The price closed below both the short-term and long-term moving averages, and several indicators, such as Bollinger Bands, Stochastic Oscillator, and MACD, also support a bearish interpretation.

However, the Bollinger Bands show that the stock is still within the upper and lower bands, indicating that the stock is still within its normal range.<br /><br />In conclusion, the last closing candle does not provide a clear signal for traders and investors. The lack of momentum and volume suggests that the stock may continue to trade within its current range. A break above the 50 or 200-day moving averages could be a bullish signal, while a break below the lower Bollinger Band could be a bearish signal. However, further analysis and confirmation would be needed before making any trading decisions.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr class='parent-row slight_sell sell_daily' id='QCOM'><td>QCOM</td><td>QUALCOMM Incorporated Common Stock</td><td>2024-08-02</td><td>slightly bearish</td></tr><tr class='explanation-table QCOM'><td colspan='4'>**Weekly Candle Report: 2024-07-29**<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle:**<br /><br />- **Date:** 2024-07-29<br />- **Open:** 181.5<br />- **High:** 182.64<br />- **Low:** 157.53<br />- **Close:** 159.31<br />- **Adj Close:** 159.31<br />- **Volume:** 98,605,322<br /><br />**Candle Qualities:**<br /><br />- **Bullish or Bearish:** Bearish (closed below the open price)<br />- **Candle Type:** Doji (small real body, long upper and lower wicks)<br />- **Engulfing Pattern:** None observed<br />- **Trend:** Downtrend (price action continues the downtrend from the previous weeks)<br /><br />**Technical Details:**<br /><br />- **Support Levels:** 157.53 (week's low), 155.0 (previous week's low)<br />- **Resistance Levels:** 181.5 (week's open), 185.0 (previous week's high)<br />- **Moving Averages (SMA & EMA):** SMA_50 (152.04), SMA_200 (141.51), EMA_50 (152.04), EMA_200 (141.51)<br />- **RSI (14):** 40.0 (moving towards oversold territory)<br />- **MACD (12_26_12):** -0.99 (bearish signal, below zero line)<br />- **BBands (20_2.0):** Upper (181.5), Middle (160.5), Lower (140.5)<br />- **ATR (14):** 8.55 (decreasing, indicating lower volatility)<br /><br />**Entry Signal:**<br /><br />- **Buy:** None (price action is bearish, and RSI is not oversold)<br />- **Sell:** Potential sell entry at 159.31 (last closing price) with a stop loss at 162.0 (above the recent high) and a take profit at 155.0 (below the recent low).

The stock is currently in a bullish trend, but the price is below both the EMA_50 and EMA_200. The stock is also in the upper band of the Bollinger Bands, which is typically a bullish sign. However, the MACDh is negative and the ATRr is high, which could be bearish signs. Overall, it may be best to take a neutral position and wait for further price action.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr class='parent-row slight_buy sell_daily' id='ROP'><td>ROP</td><td>Roper Technologies Inc.

Therefore, it may be best to adopt a neutral stance until there are more clear signals.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-31</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 118.59 (2024-07-31)<br /><br />**Price Data:**<br /><br />| **Metric** | **Value** |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| Open | 119.64 |<br />| High | 119.76 |<br />| Low | 118.56 |<br />| Close | 118.59 |<br />| Adj Close | 118.59 |<br />| Volume | 10,461,459 |<br /><br />**Price Change:** The price has increased by 0.42% compared to the previous day's close of 118.17.<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />| **Metric** | **Value** |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| SMA_50 | 114.16 |<br />| SMA_200 | 109.41 |<br />| EMA_50 | 114.9 |<br />| EMA_200 | 111.48 |<br /><br />**Trend Indicators:** The price is below both the SMA_50 and SMA_200, indicating a bearish trend.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI_14):** The RSI_14 is at 59.97, which is close to the neutral zone of 50.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** The MACD_12_26_12 is positive (1.02), but the MACDh_12_26_12 is negative (-0.42), and MACDs_12_26_12 is also negative (-0.6), indicating a bearish trend.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:** The BBL_20_2.0, BBM_20_2.0, BBU_20_2.0, BBB_20_2.0, and BBP_20_2.0 are all below the close price, indicating a bearish trend.<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:** The STOCHk_14_3_3 is at 81.88, and STOCHd_14_3_3 is at 74.03, indicating a potential overbought situation.<br /><br />**Average True Range (ATRr_14):** The ATRr_14 is at 2.15, indicating high volatility.<br /><br />**Conclusion:** The last closing candle does not indicate a clear bullish or bearish trend.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also above 50, indicating that the bullish momentum is still present.<br /><br />However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram is starting to flatten, which could be a sign that the uptrend is losing some momentum. The Bollinger Bands are expanding, indicating increasing volatility in the market. The price is currently near the upper Bollinger Band, which could be a sign of overbought conditions. However, the price has been able to break above the upper Bollinger Band in the past, so this may not necessarily be a bearish signal.<br /><br />Overall, the last closing candle suggests that the market is still in a bullish trend, but there are some signs that the uptrend may be losing some momentum. Investors and traders may want to exercise caution and consider taking profits or implementing risk management strategies. However, based on the information provided, there is no clear signal to be bullish, bearish, or neutral. It is recommended to consider other factors and indicators before making a decision.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-25</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-25<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 115.17<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 115.17<br /><br />**High Price:** 118.03<br /><br />**Low Price:** 114.57<br /><br />**Volume:** 12,200,642<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| Indicator | Value |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| SMA_50 | 114.23 |<br />| SMA_200 | 109.23 |<br />| EMA_50 | 114.43 |<br />| EMA_200 | 111.23 |<br />| RSI_14 | 58.12 |<br />| MACD_12_26_12 | 0.34 |<br /><br />**Trend Analysis:**<br /><br />The last closing candle indicates a slightly bullish trend, as the close price is higher than the previous day's close and above the SMA_50 and EMA_50.
