A higher ATR value indicates greater volatility, while a lower ATR value suggests lower volatility.<br /><br />**Conclusion**<br /><br />Based on this analysis, the last closing candle does not necessarily indicate a clear bullish or bearish trend. The stock price has been range-bound for the past few days, and the indicators are relatively neutral. However, the fact that the close price is near the lower Bollinger Band and the 50-day EMA is above the 200-day EMA could suggest that the stock may be due for a rebound in the near term. As always, traders and investors should consider multiple factors and indicators when making investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-05</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**____________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-05<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 167.25<br /><br />**Percentage Change from Previous Day:** 2.31%<br /><br />**Trading Volume:** 5,978,300<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA): 165.9600067138672<br />* 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA): 159.96414023903085<br /><br />**Current Price Relative to Moving Averages:** The stock is currently trading above both its short-term and long-term moving averages.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** The RSI is 55.42, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.<br /><br />**Exponential Moving Averages (EMA):**<br /><br />* 12-day EMA: 166.08999633789062<br />* 26-day EMA: 164.66000366210938<br />* 9-day EMA: 166.4199981689453<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands (BB):** The BB are in an uptrend, with the upper band at 176.39639521754876 and the lower band at 158.60779293739543.

Therefore, it may be a good time to consider a bullish position on the stock.</td></tr><tr class='child-table AMD'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent AMD'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-08</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Report**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Trading Day:** 2024-07-08<br /><br />**Closing Price:** 178.69000244140625<br /><br />**Trend:** The stock has been in an uptrend since April with occasional minor corrections.<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />- 50-day SMA: 181.0239987182617<br />- 200-day SMA: 142.65822345463954<br />- 50-day EMA: 176.471907184374<br />- 200-day EMA: 143.1764674394139<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** The RSI for the last closing candle is 62.44, which is above the neutral level of 50.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** The MACD line (12-26-12) crossed above the signal line, indicating a buy signal.

This represents a bullish candle, with a large increase in price from the open to the close. The close is also significantly above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages (SMA 50 and SMA 200), indicating a strong uptrend.<br /><br />The relative strength index (RSI) is at 70.97954000362625, which is above 70, indicating that the stock is overbought.

The Bollinger Band width (BBP 20 2.0) is relatively low, indicating decreased volatility.<br /><br />The stochastic oscillator (STOCHk 14 3 3 and STOCHd 14 3 3) is also bullish, with both the %K and %D lines above 80, indicating that the stock is overbought.

An increased volume indicates a strong interest in the stock, which can be either buying or selling interest. In this case, since the candle is bullish, the increased volume is a positive sign, as it shows that buyers were more aggressive.<br /><br />**Technical Indicator Analysis:**<br />-------------------------------<br /><br />Three commonly used technical indicators to analyze the last closing candle are:<br /><br />1. **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** The RSI for the last candle is 76.99, which is above the overbought threshold of 70. This suggests that the stock might be overbought, and a correction might be expected in the near future. However, it's important to note that the RSI is a momentum indicator, and momentum can persist for some time even after reaching overbought levels.<br /><br />2. **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** The MACD line (12.07) is above the signal line (1.96), indicating a bullish signal. However, the MACD histogram is showing a decreasing trend, which might suggest that the bullish momentum is fading.<br /><br />3. **Bollinger Bands:** The closing price (D) is above the upper Bollinger Band (1035.55), which is a strong bullish signal. However, the width of the Bollinger Bands is increasing, indicating that the stock's volatility is increasing.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br />-------------<br /><br />The last closing candle is a bullish candle, with a higher closing price than the opening price, an increased volume, and a position above the upper Bollinger Band. These are all strong bullish signals. However, the RSI, MACD, and increasing Bollinger Band width suggest that the stock might be overbought, and a correction might be expected in the near future. Therefore, it might be a good time to be cautiously bullish, with a focus on risk management.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-01</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Closing Price Data:** _2024-07-01_<br /><br />| **Metric**                   | **Value**                         |<br />|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|<br />| Open                         | 1035.55 (0.000048828125)          |<br />| High                         | 1037.69 (0.0000625)                |<br />| Low                          | 1015.79 (0.0000877929688)          |<br />| Close                        | 1027.73 (0.00008046875)           |<br />| SMA_50                      | 961.79 (0.000096179128710937)      |<br />| SMA_200                     | 821.86 (0.00008218599990844726)    |<br />| EMA_50                      | 1016.84 (0.00010168381816671315)   |<br />| EMA_200                     | 982.95 (0.00019829460847308886)    |<br />| RSI_14                      | 58.63 (0.00005862634316979156)     |<br />| MACD_12_26_12             | 17.86 (0.0001785599077686975)      |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12            | 0.62 (0.00006213201795582223)     |<br />| MACDs_12_26_12            | -5.40 (0.0005403371282026729)     |<br />| BBL_20_2.0                | 921.94 (0.00009219368267768679)   |<br />| BBM_20_2.0                | 1013.97 (0.00010139677357601892)  |<br />| BBU_20_2.0                | 1067.95 (0.00010679522812685285)  |<br />| BBB_20_2.0                | 973.97 (0.00009739677357601892)   |<br />| BBP_20_2.0                | 995.96 (0.00009959600219726562)   |<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3            | 50.88 (0.000050880948710475764)    |<br />| STOCHd_14_3_3            | 54.91 (0.00005490883088562905)     |<br />| ATRr_14                    | 28.63 (0.00028626343169791568)      |<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* The stock price closed above both the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA_50) and 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA_200), indicating a strong uptrend.<br />* The Exponential Moving Averages (EMA_50 and EMA_200) also show an uptrend, with the 50-day EMA above the 200-day EMA.<br />* The Relative Strength Index (RSI_14) is at 58.63, which is close to the neutral zone (50), but still leaning towards overbought conditions.<br />* The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators show a positive MACD line (12-day EMA minus 26-day EMA) and a positive histogram, which is a bullish sign.<br />* The Stochastic Oscillator (STOCHk_14_3_3 and STOCHd_14_3_3) is in bullish territory, with the %K line above the %D line.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle on _2024-07-01_ indicates a bullish outlook for the stock.

The close price is also below both the 50-day and 200-day SMAs, indicating a longer-term downward trend.

The short lower wick suggests little buying interest at lower prices.<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />The 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is 250.83, and the 200-day SMA is 248.51. The price is above both the 50-day and 200-day SMAs, indicating an uptrend.<br /><br />**Exponential Moving Averages:**<br /><br />The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is 251.33, and the 200-day EMA is 249.51. The 50-day EMA is above the 200-day EMA, indicating a bullish trend.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):**<br /><br />The RSI is at 52.5, which is in the neutral zone.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />The MACD line is 0.012, and the signal line is 0. The MACD line is above the signal line, indicating a neutral trend.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle suggests a slightly bullish sentiment, but with some resistance at higher prices. The overall trend is still bullish, with the price above both the 50-day and 200-day SMAs. However, traders should be cautious of the resistance at higher prices and monitor the stock for any signs of a reversal. It may be a good time to consider a neutral to slightly bullish stance, but with a close eye on the stock's performance.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-03</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** _250.0_<br /><br />**Open Price:** _248.5_<br /><br />**High Price:** _250.97999572753906_<br /><br />**Low Price:** _248.17999267578125_<br /><br />**Volume:** _2,026,100_<br /><br />The following analysis is based on the price data from the last closing candle on 2024-07-03.<br /><br />**Candle Analysis:**<br /><br />The last closing candle exhibited a bullish pattern, also known as a hammer, characterized by a small real body near the high of the candle, a long lower wick, and a short or nonexistent upper wick. This indicates that the market opened lower than the closing price, buyers stepped in and pushed the price up, but sellers managed to bring the price back down near the open price. The long lower wick signifies strong buying interest, and the closing price being above the open price is a positive sign.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):**<br /><br />The RSI for the last closing candle was 50.17, which is a neutral value, neither overbought nor oversold. This suggests that the market is currently in equilibrium between buyers and sellers.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />The MACD, which consists of the MACD line (12-day exponential moving average - 26-day exponential moving average) and the signal line (9-day exponential moving average of MACD), was relatively flat. The MACD line was at -0.04, and the signal line was at 0.01, indicating no clear short-term trend in the market.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands, consisting of a 20-day simple moving average and two standard deviation lines, showed that the last closing price was near the lower Bollinger Band. This suggests that the stock is currently oversold and may be due for a rebound.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle indicates a neutral to slightly bullish outlook. The hammer-like shape of the candle, along with the closing price being above the open price, suggests that buyers are present in the market. However, the relatively flat MACD and the oversold condition based on the Bollinger Bands suggest that the market may be in a state of equilibrium or consolidation. Traders and investors should consider these factors and other market conditions before making decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-02</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-02<br /><br />**Open:** *249.67999267578125*<br /><br />**High:** *251.02999877929688*<br /><br />**Low:** *247.41000366210938*<br /><br />**Close:** *247.7899932861328*<br /><br />The stock opened at 249.67999267578125, reached a high of 251.02999877929688, dipped to a low of 247.41000366210938, and closed at 247.7899932861328.<br /><br />**Trend Analysis:**<br /><br />* The closing price is lower than both the open and the previous day's close (254.8300018310547), indicating a bearish trend.<br />* The stock has been on a downtrend since April 3rd, with occasional rallies that were not sustained.<br /><br />**Moving Average Analysis:**<br /><br />* The 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is 253.123511328125.<br />* The 200-day SMA is 261.536005859375.<br />* The stock has recently fallen below both SMAs, which could indicate a shift in the short-term trend.<br /><br />**Technical Indicator Analysis:**<br /><br />* The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 25.41, significantly below the neutral level of 50, indicating oversold conditions.<br />* The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) lines are both negative, with the signal line crossing below the MACD line, further supporting the bearish outlook.<br /><br />**Volatility Analysis:**<br /><br />* The Bollinger Bands show that the last closing price is near the lower band, indicating that the stock is trading at the lower end of its recent volatility range.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle suggests a bearish trend, with the stock closing lower than both the open and the previous day's close.

This formation suggests that the market opened near the low, traded lower during the period, but then rallied back to close near the high, potentially indicating a bullish reversal.<br /><br />**Trend Indicators:** ______________________________________________<br /><br />* The 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is at 590.371003, and the 200-day SMA is at 473.644050.<br />* The 50-day SMA is above the 200-day SMA, indicating an uptrend.<br />* The close is above both the 50-day and 200-day SMAs, which is a bullish sign.<br /><br />**Oscillator Indicators:** __________________________________________<br /><br />* The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 62.438509, which is above the neutral level of 50, indicating that the stock is overbought.<br />* The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is positive, with the MACD line (12-26-12) above the signal line (9-day EMA of the MACD line), indicating a bullish trend.<br />* The Bollinger Bands (20, 2.0) show that the close is near the upper Bollinger Band, indicating that the stock is overbought.<br />* The Stochastic Oscillator (14, 3, 3) is at 93.396467, which is above the overbought level of 80, indicating that the stock is overbought.<br /><br />**Conclusion:** ______________________________________________________<br /><br />The last closing candle is a bullish candle, and the technical indicators suggest a bullish trend. However, the stock is overbought, and some oscillator indicators, such as the RSI and Stochastic Oscillator, are above their overbought levels. Therefore, it is essential to monitor the price action and technical indicators closely to confirm the bullish reversal and ensure that the uptrend continues. Overall, the current data suggests a slightly bullish bias, but caution is advised due to the overbought conditions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-01</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report**:**\*<br /><br />**Price Data:** The last closing price was recorded on 2024-07-01, with a value of 673.61.<br /><br />**Candle Statistics:** The open price was 675.02, the high was 675.02, the low was 663.81, and the close was 673.61.<br /><br />**Trend Indicators:** The Simple Moving Average (SMA)_50 is currently at 626.86, and the SMA_200 is at 472.72.

This candle had a relatively small body, with the close being slightly higher than the open, and a long wick on the bottom, indicating that there was significant selling pressure during the week, but buyers were able to push the price back up towards the end of the week.<br /><br />**Volume:** 20197289<br /><br />The volume for this candle was **20197289**, which is slightly above average for the past 90 days. This indicates that there was a higher level of trading activity during this week compared to other weeks in the past 90 days.<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* 50-day simple moving average (SMA): 170.64979919433594<br />* 200-day SMA: 164.832250289917<br /><br />The 50-day SMA is currently at **170.64979919433594**, while the 200-day SMA is at **164.832250289917**.

This indicates that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) Indicator:**<br /><br />The MACD indicator is currently negative, with the MACD line below the signal line.

While the 50-day SMA is above the 200-day SMA, the close for the last candle is below both of these averages, and the MACD indicator is negative. However, the volume for the last candle was slightly above average, indicating that there may be some interest in the stock at current levels. It may be worth waiting for further confirmation of a downtrend before taking a bearish position.</td></tr><tr class='child-table PEP'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent PEP'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-08</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report******<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-08<br /><br />**Open:** 163.05999755859375<br /><br />**High:** 163.75<br /><br />**Low:** 161.9199981689453<br /><br />**Close:** 162.1199951171875<br /><br />**Volume:** 5266600<br /><br />**Technical Details:**<br /><br />* SMA_50: 168.8231994628906<br />* SMA_200: 172.3161000061035<br />* EMA_50: 169.0800911296293<br />* EMA_200: 171.21866210460027<br />* RSI_14: 53.299309732764954<br />* MACD_12_26_12: 0.7513438829854238<br />* MACDh_12_26_12: -0.2220873241403123<br />* MACDs_12_26_12: 0.973431207125736<br />* BBL_20_2.0: 163.94699384622356<br />* BBM_20_2.0: 170.0944948505992<br />* BBU_20_2.0: 176.24199585497485<br />* BBB_20_2.0: 7.228336237190083<br />* BBP_20_2.0: 0.541928074463545<br />* STOCHk_14_3_3: 164.3858305512531<br />* STOCHd_14_3_3: 169.98549505037474<br />* ATRr_14: 24.410480408083302<br /><br />**Bearish Signals:**<br /><br />* The closing price is lower than the opening price, indicating selling pressure was stronger than buying pressure.<br />* All moving averages (SMA_50, SMA_200, EMA_50, and EMA_200) are above the closing price.<br />* RSI_14 is close to the neutral zone (50), but does not provide a strong enough counterargument given the other bearish signals.<br /><br />In conclusion, the last closing candle indicates a bearish outlook.

This price was slightly lower than the opening price of 165.9499969482422, indicating a downward trend during the trading session. However, the difference between the opening and closing prices was relatively small, and the trading volume for this candle was above average.

Market Analysis<br /><br />The last closing candle for the 90-day daily chart on July 8, 2024, indicates a slightly bearish trend, as the close is lower than the open and the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. However, the RSI is at 54.13, which is relatively neutral, and the MACD is positive, suggesting some bullish momentum. The volume for this candle is also lower than the previous day, which could indicate decreased interest in the stock.<br /><br />In conclusion, the last closing candle suggests a slightly bearish outlook, but the neutral RSI and positive MACD indicate that the trend is not definitively bearish. It may be a good time for cautious investors to consider entering the market, while more aggressive investors might wait for a clearer trend.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-05</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**____________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-05<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 73.25<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| **Indicator** | **Value** |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| 50-day SMA | 68.8772 |<br />| 200-day SMA | 70.9762 |<br />| 20-day EMA | 73.94 |<br />| Relative Strength Index (RSI) | 51.78 |<br />| Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) |<br />| MACD Line | 0.0565 |<br />| Signal Line | 0.4612 |<br />| Bollinger Bands | Closing price near upper band |<br />| Stochastic Oscillator | 81.72 |<br /><br />**Price Action:**<br /><br />The last closing candle occurred on 2024-07-05 with a closing price of 73.25. This price is above both the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of 68.8772 and the 200-day SMA of 70.9762, indicating a potential bullish trend. However, the price is below the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) of 73.94, suggesting some bearish pressure in the short term.<br /><br />**Moving Average Indicators:**<br /><br />The 50-day SMA is below the 200-day SMA, indicating a long-term bullish trend. However, the short-term trend is bearish as the closing price is below the 20-day EMA.<br /><br />**Oscillator Indicators:**<br /><br />The RSI is at 51.78, which is close to the neutral zone (50), indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. The MACD lines are positive, with the MACD line (12-day EMA - 26-day EMA) at 0.0565 and the signal line (9-day EMA of MACD) at 0.4612, which is a bullish sign.<br /><br />**Volatility Indicators:**<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands show that the closing price is near the upper band, suggesting that the stock might be overextended in the short term.

Traders might consider short-term bearish strategies, such as selling call options or buying put options, while maintaining a long-term bullish outlook.

The open price was 174.24, and the high and low prices for the day were 175.30 and 170.45, respectively. This indicates that the stock opened slightly higher than the closing price, reached a high of 175.30 during the day, and dipped to a low of 170.45 before closing.<br /><br />**Moving Averages**<br /><br />The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is 154.97, and the 200-day SMA is 130.37. The stock has been in an overall uptrend, as the 50-day SMA is above the 200-day SMA. However, the 50-day SMA has been decreasing in recent days, indicating a potential slowdown in the uptrend.<br /><br />The exponential moving averages (EMAs) for 50 and 200 days are 154.93 and 130.04, respectively. The EMAs are also above the SMAs, and the 50-day EMA has been decreasing while the 200-day EMA has been increasing. This could suggest a potential bearish signal, as the short-term trend is downward while the long-term trend is upward.<br /><br />**Technical Indicators**<br /><br />The relative strength index (RSI) for the last closing candle is 49.52, which is close to the neutral threshold of 50. This suggests that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, and that the recent price action has been relatively stable.<br /><br />The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicators are also close to neutral, with the MACD line at -0.05 and the signal line at 0.01. This suggests that there is currently no strong momentum in the market, and that the stock may be due for a breakout in either direction.<br /><br />**Conclusion**<br /><br />Based on the analysis, it may be appropriate to adopt a neutral stance towards the stock. While the long-term trend has been upward, the recent downward trend in the 50-day SMA and EMA suggests that the stock may be due for a correction. However, the RSI and MACD indicators are close to neutral, suggesting that the market is currently in a state of equilibrium. Therefore, it may be best to wait for further price action before making a decision.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-28</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Report**____________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-06-28<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 173.80999755859375<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 172.80999755859375<br /><br />**High:** 176.82000732421875<br /><br />**Low:** 172.80999755859375<br /><br />**Volume:** 11203600<br /><br />**Adj.

The ATR is relatively high at 13.104416600250564, indicating high volatility.<br /><br />In conclusion, the last closing candle indicates bearish conditions due to the lower close compared to the open and the negative MACD. However, the oversold conditions indicated by the RSI and Stochastic Oscillator suggest a potential rebound. The high volume and the position of the close near the lower Bollinger Band also support this possibility. Therefore, it might be a good time for cautious bullish positions, but it is essential to monitor the market closely for any changes in trends.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-03</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-03<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 497.1199951171875<br /><br />**High:** 498.0799865722656<br /><br />**Low:** 486.5199890136719<br /><br />**Closing Price:** 489.8900146484375<br /><br />**Volume:** 2239200<br /><br />**Candle Analysis:**<br /><br />This candle represents a bearish trend, as the closing price of 489.8900146484375 is lower than the opening price of 497.1199951171875.<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** The RSI value for this candle is 10.5023865878414, which is a very low reading.

Additionally, the lack of momentum and neutral RSI suggest that the stock is currently in a holding pattern.<br /><br />Therefore, investors may want to **wait for further confirmation of a trend** before making any decisions. It may be wise to wait for a breakout above the upper Bollinger Band or a sustained move above the 50-day moving average before taking a bullish position. Conversely, a break below the lower Bollinger Band or a sustained move below the 50-day moving average could be a bearish signal.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-03</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Candle Data:**<br /><br />| **Metric**          | **Value**                       |<br />|---------------------|--------------------------------|<br />| Open price          | 114.2699966430664              |<br />| High price         | 115.66000366210938             |<br />| Low price          | 114.2699966430664              |<br />| Close price        | 114.76000213623047              |<br />| Volume             | 7732900                        |<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| **Indicator**        | **Value**                          |<br />|---------------------|----------------------------------|<br />| SMA_50             | 115.25280029296874               |<br />| SMA_200            | 109.28064990997315               |<br />| EMA_50             | 115.09960037231446               |<br />| EMA_200            | 114.05509356948099               |<br />| RSI_14             | 54.02597963951406               |<br />| MACD_12_26_12     | 0.016053814681043832             |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12   | 0.6701304746442832             |<br />| MACDs_12_26_12   | -0.6540766599632394             |<br />| BBL_20_2.0        | 109.39216321487547               |<br />| BBM_20_2.0        | 117.85200653030901               |<br />| BBU_20_2.0        | 114.02632179124632               |<br />| BBB_20_2.0        | 110.62762254052552               |<br />| BBP_20_2.0        | 114.18000030517578               |<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3    | 0.016053814681043832             |<br />| STOCHd_14_3_3    | 0.6701304746442832             |<br />| ATRr_14            | 0.6345080778933923               |<br /><br />**Analysis:**<br /><br />The last closing candle of the stock opened at 114.2699966430664, reached a high of 115.66000366210938, and closed at 114.76000213623047. The close price is slightly lower than the open price, indicating a downward trend in the short term. However, the close price is still above the SMA_50 and SMA_200, which are both long-term moving averages, suggesting a bullish trend in the long term.<br /><br />The RSI_14 is 54.02597963951406, which is close to the neutral zone (50), indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. The MACD indicators suggest a bullish trend, as the MACD line is above the signal line and the histogram is positive.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands show that the close price is near the upper band, indicating that the stock is trading near the high end of its recent range. The Stochastic Oscillator is also indicating a bullish trend, as the %K line is above the %D line.<br /><br />Overall, the last closing candle suggests a slightly bearish trend in the short term, but a bullish trend in the long term. Investors may want to consider a neutral to slightly bullish stance, and monitor the stock for any further downward trends in the short term. However, the long-term trend remains bullish, and investors may want to consider buying opportunities if the stock price dips below the SMA_50 or SMA_200.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-02</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**<br /><br />**Candle Data:**<br /><br />| **Parameter** | **Value** |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| Open price | 115.9000015258789 |<br />| High price | 115.94000244140625 |<br />| Low price | 113.48999786376953 |<br />| Close price | 114.18000030517578 |<br />| Volume | 13,325,100 |<br /><br />The last closing candle exhibited a bearish trend, as the close price of 114.18000030517578 was lower than the previous day's close.
