This candle pattern is characterized by a long lower wick and a small body near the high of the candle. The long lower wick indicates that there was significant selling pressure during the period, but the bulls managed to push the price back up, resulting in a close near the high.<br /><br />**Price Action:**<br /><br />The open price of the candle is lower than the close price, which is a bullish sign. Additionally, the high of the candle is significantly higher than the open price, indicating strong buying pressure.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):**<br /><br />The RSI for the last closing candle is 70.54, which is above the overbought threshold of 70.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />The MACD indicator is bullish, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />Based on the provided technical analysis, the last closing candle is a bullish candle, with a long lower wick and a small body near the high. The open price is lower than the close price, and the high is significantly higher than the open price. The RSI is above the overbought threshold, but the MACD indicator is bullish. Overall, the technical analysis suggests that the stock is in a bullish trend, but investors should be aware of the potential for a short-term correction due to the overbought RSI. It's important to note that technical analysis is not a guarantee of future performance, and investors should always do their own research and consider their own risk tolerance before making investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='child-table AAPL'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent AAPL'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-02</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Trading Day:** 2024-07-02<br /><br />**Closing Price:** 220.27000427246094<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 216.14999389648438<br /><br />**High of the Day:** 220.3800048828125<br /><br />**Low of the Day:** 215.10000610351562<br /><br />**Trading Volume:** 57960500<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Technical Indicators**<br /><br />**14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 86.95725059509277<br /><br />**50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA):** 199.46799926757814<br /><br />**200-day SMA:** 183.29720016479493<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />**MACD Line:** 12, 26, 12 - Crossed above the signal line<br /><br />**Histogram:** Positive value of 6.652217098237287<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />**Price:** Above the upper band<br /><br />**Upper Keltner Channel:** Above the current price<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Summary:**<br /><br />The closing price on 2024-07-02 was higher than the opening price, indicating a bullish sentiment for the day. The RSI, however, is significantly above the neutral level of 50, suggesting that the stock may be overbought and due for a correction.

The closing price is higher than both the opening price and the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which are 180.453 and 183.379, respectively. This suggests a long-term bullish trend.<br /><br />However, the price has fluctuated within a range of 211.919 to 217.509 during the period, and the closing price is near the high of the candle and the upper Bollinger band. This indicates an overbought market, as confirmed by the RSI, which is above 50 at 62.873, and the stochastic oscillator, which is at 97.542.<br /><br />The MACD is positive, with the MACD line above the signal line, indicating a bullish trend.

An increased volume indicates a strong interest in the stock, which can be either buying or selling interest. In this case, since the candle is bullish, the increased volume is a positive sign, as it shows that buyers were more aggressive.<br /><br />**Technical Indicator Analysis:**<br />-------------------------------<br /><br />Three commonly used technical indicators to analyze the last closing candle are:<br /><br />1. **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** The RSI for the last candle is 76.99, which is above the overbought threshold of 70. This suggests that the stock might be overbought, and a correction might be expected in the near future. However, it's important to note that the RSI is a momentum indicator, and momentum can persist for some time even after reaching overbought levels.<br /><br />2. **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** The MACD line (12.07) is above the signal line (1.96), indicating a bullish signal. However, the MACD histogram is showing a decreasing trend, which might suggest that the bullish momentum is fading.<br /><br />3. **Bollinger Bands:** The closing price (D) is above the upper Bollinger Band (1035.55), which is a strong bullish signal. However, the width of the Bollinger Bands is increasing, indicating that the stock's volatility is increasing.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br />-------------<br /><br />The last closing candle is a bullish candle, with a higher closing price than the opening price, an increased volume, and a position above the upper Bollinger Band. These are all strong bullish signals. However, the RSI, MACD, and increasing Bollinger Band width suggest that the stock might be overbought, and a correction might be expected in the near future. Therefore, it might be a good time to be cautiously bullish, with a focus on risk management.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-01</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Closing Price Data:** _2024-07-01_<br /><br />| **Metric**                   | **Value**                         |<br />|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|<br />| Open                         | 1035.55 (0.000048828125)          |<br />| High                         | 1037.69 (0.0000625)                |<br />| Low                          | 1015.79 (0.0000877929688)          |<br />| Close                        | 1027.73 (0.00008046875)           |<br />| SMA_50                      | 961.79 (0.000096179128710937)      |<br />| SMA_200                     | 821.86 (0.00008218599990844726)    |<br />| EMA_50                      | 1016.84 (0.00010168381816671315)   |<br />| EMA_200                     | 982.95 (0.00019829460847308886)    |<br />| RSI_14                      | 58.63 (0.00005862634316979156)     |<br />| MACD_12_26_12             | 17.86 (0.0001785599077686975)      |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12            | 0.62 (0.00006213201795582223)     |<br />| MACDs_12_26_12            | -5.40 (0.0005403371282026729)     |<br />| BBL_20_2.0                | 921.94 (0.00009219368267768679)   |<br />| BBM_20_2.0                | 1013.97 (0.00010139677357601892)  |<br />| BBU_20_2.0                | 1067.95 (0.00010679522812685285)  |<br />| BBB_20_2.0                | 973.97 (0.00009739677357601892)   |<br />| BBP_20_2.0                | 995.96 (0.00009959600219726562)   |<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3            | 50.88 (0.000050880948710475764)    |<br />| STOCHd_14_3_3            | 54.91 (0.00005490883088562905)     |<br />| ATRr_14                    | 28.63 (0.00028626343169791568)      |<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* The stock price closed above both the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA_50) and 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA_200), indicating a strong uptrend.<br />* The Exponential Moving Averages (EMA_50 and EMA_200) also show an uptrend, with the 50-day EMA above the 200-day EMA.<br />* The Relative Strength Index (RSI_14) is at 58.63, which is close to the neutral zone (50), but still leaning towards overbought conditions.<br />* The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators show a positive MACD line (12-day EMA minus 26-day EMA) and a positive histogram, which is a bullish sign.<br />* The Stochastic Oscillator (STOCHk_14_3_3 and STOCHd_14_3_3) is in bullish territory, with the %K line above the %D line.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle on _2024-07-01_ indicates a bullish outlook for the stock.

The high price of the day was 1041.7099609375, and the low price was 1024.6400146484375.

The current ATR value suggests that the stock has been experiencing moderate volatility.<br /><br />Based on the last closing candle's qualities and relevant technical details, the stock market is showing mixed signals. While the closing price is above both short- and long-term moving averages, the narrowing gap in the MACD histogram and the stock's position in the Bollinger Bands suggest a potential slowdown in the bullish trend. However, the stock's stochastic K%D line being above the 0.5 level and the positive MACD line still indicate a bullish outlook.<br /><br />Therefore, it may be prudent to adopt a neutral stance, carefully monitoring the stock's performance and waiting for clearer trends to emerge before making a decision to be bullish or bearish.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-26</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Report**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Trading Day:** 2024-06-26<br /><br />**Closing Price:** 1016.5999755859375<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 1014.0<br /><br />**50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA):** 925.5808020019531<br /><br />**200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA):** 769.1920247266263<br /><br />**50-day SMA > 200-day SMA:** Yes<br /><br />**Closing Price > 50-day and 200-day SMAs:** Yes<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 55.36392784803285<br /><br />**RSI Range:** Neutral (above 30 and below 70)<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) Histogram:** 19.694867657001108<br /><br />**MACD Signal Line > MACD Histogram:** Yes<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />* Closing Price near Upper Band<br />* Price within Bollinger Bands<br /><br />**Average True Range (ATR):** 28.582979411259945<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />The closing price on 2024-06-26 was higher than the opening price, indicating a bullish sentiment for the day.

Analysis**<br /><br />The last closing candle on 2024-06-26 has a bullish bias, with a higher close compared to the open and a higher high compared to the previous day. The stock has been trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating a positive trend. The RSI value of 59.72 suggests that the stock is not overbought, leaving room for further upside potential.<br /><br />However, the MACD histogram has been decreasing, indicating a potential bearish divergence. The STOCHastic oscillator is also showing a bearish crossover, which could suggest a short-term pullback.<br /><br />In summary, while the overall trend remains bullish, investors should be aware of potential short-term weakness. A pullback to the support level around the 50-day moving average could provide a buying opportunity for those looking to enter or add to their positions. However, stops should be set to limit potential losses if the stock breaks below this support level.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-25</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Trading Day:** 2024-06-25<br /><br />**Closing Price:** 855.510009765625<br /><br />**Analysis:**<br /><br />The closing price on 2024-06-25 is higher than the previous day's close, indicating a potential bullish sentiment.

This is a slightly lower close than the previous week's close of 109.88999938964844, indicating a potential downward trend. However, the closing price is still above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of 101.54923998624638 and the 200-day SMA of 96.9816275888688, which could be interpreted as a bullish sign.<br /><br />**Technical Indicators**<br /><br />The RSI for the last closing price is 5.97252656, which is well below the oversold threshold of 30, indicating that the stock is not oversold. The MACD histogram is negative at -3.099067, suggesting a bearish trend. However, the MACD lines are still above the signal line, which could be interpreted as a bullish sign.<br /><br />The Bollinger bands show that the last closing price is near the lower band, indicating that the stock is currently trading near the lower end of its recent range. The stochastic oscillator is at 7.22133092, which is below the oversold threshold of 20, indicating that the stock is oversold.<br /><br />**Conclusion**<br /><br />The last closing candle suggests a mixed picture, with some bullish and bearish signals. The stock is trading near the lower end of its recent range, but it is still above key moving averages. The RSI and stochastic oscillator suggest that the stock is oversold, while the MACD histogram suggests a bearish trend. Therefore, it may be wise to adopt a neutral stance and closely monitor the stock's performance in the coming weeks.</td></tr><tr class='child-table FMX'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent FMX'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-02</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**__________________________________________<br /><br />**Price Data for Last Closing Candle (2024-07-02):**<br /><br />| **Metric**          | **Value**                   |<br />|---------------------|-----------------------------|<br />| Open                | 108.44000244140625          |<br />| High                | 109.69000244140625          |<br />| Low                 | 106.87000274658203          |<br />| Close               | 107.51000213623047          |<br /><br />**Price Trend Observations:**<br /><br />1.

However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI_14) is at 47.58, which is in the neutral range, neither overbought nor oversold. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators are also relatively flat, suggesting a sideways trend.<br /><br />Based on this analysis, the last closing candle does not provide a clear indication of whether to be bullish, bearish, or neutral. The moving averages are in a bullish trend, but the RSI and MACD indicators are neutral, and the price action is sideways. Therefore, it might be best to wait for more data before making a trading decision.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-27</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Technical Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-06-27<br /><br />**Price Data:**<br /><br />* Open: 440.6700134277344<br />* High: 441.5299987792969<br />* Low: 437.54998779296875<br />* Close: 440.2200012207031<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />**Candle Analysis:**<br /><br />The last closing candle is a bullish candle, as the closing price is higher than the opening price.<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* The close price is above the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA_50) and the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA_200), which are both bullish signs.<br />* The Exponential Moving Averages (EMA_50 and EMA_200) show a bullish crossover.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI_14):**<br /><br />The RSI_14 is at 53.54, which is a neutral level.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD_12_26_12):**<br /><br />The MACD_12_26_12 is currently negative but close to crossing above the signal line, which is a bullish signal.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands (BB_20_2.0):**<br /><br />The last closing price is within the Bollinger Bands, indicating that the price is within the normal range.<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator (STOCHk_14_3_3):**<br /><br />The STOCHk_14_3_3 is at 57.57, which is a neutral level.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle is a bullish candle, and the technical indicators are mostly bullish or neutral.

The closing price was near the high of the day, indicating a strong upward price movement.<br /><br />The **50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA)** was **729.4635895770662**, and the **200-day SMA** was **604.463655242342**. The 50-day SMA was above the 200-day SMA, indicating an uptrend. The closing price was above both SMAs, which was a bullish signal.<br /><br />The **50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA)** was **787.2999036842519**, and the **200-day EMA** was **606.1899872496089**. The 50-day EMA was above the 200-day EMA, further confirming the uptrend. The closing price was above both EMAs, which was a positive sign.<br /><br />The **14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI)** was **61.053554333783104**, which was close to the overbought threshold of 70. However, this did not necessarily mean that the stock was overbought, but rather that the upward momentum was strong.<br /><br />The **MACD (12, 26, 12)** was **14.449123329839331**. The MACD line (12-day EMA - 26-day EMA) was above the signal line (9-day EMA of MACD line), indicating a bullish signal and an uptrend.<br /><br />The **Bollinger Bands (20, 2.0)** showed that the closing price was near the upper band, indicating that the stock was trading near the high end of its recent volatility range.

This suggested that the stock might be overbought in the short term, but it did not necessarily mean that a downward correction would occur.<br /><br />Based on the analysis of the last closing candle and the various technical indicators, the stock appears to be in an uptrend. The closing price near the high of the day, above both SMAs and EMAs, and the bullish signals from the MACD and Stochastic Oscillator all suggest that the stock is likely to continue its upward momentum. However, the RSI being close to the overbought threshold and the Stochastic Oscillator being above 80 indicate that the stock might be overbought in the short term, and a downward correction could occur. Nonetheless, the overall trend remains bullish.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-24</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Report**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Trading Day:** 2024-06-24<br /><br />**Closing Price:** 890.1099853515625<br /><br />**Technical Analysis:**<br /><br />* **50-day SMA:** 730.900400390625<br />* **200-day SMA:** 600.9011999511719<br />* **50-day EMA:** 788.6300059542092<br />* **200-day EMA:** 602.717762403815<br />* **RSI:** 59.75300806014152<br />* **MACD:**<br />  * **MACD Line:** 11.270915483267686<br />  * **Signal Line:** 15.033132998432366<br />* **Bollinger Bands:**<br />  * **Last Closing Price:** Within Upper Band<br />  * **Bandwidth:** 20.24177716859855<br />* **Stochastic Oscillator:**<br />  * **%K Line:** 65.25460020877911<br />  * **%D Line:** 18.09642994026467<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />* The closing price is above both the 50-day SMA and 200-day SMA, indicating an uptrend.<br />* The EMAs also suggest an uptrend.<br />* The RSI is close to the neutral threshold of 50.<br />* The MACD indicators are positive, suggesting a bullish signal.<br />* The last closing price is within the upper Bollinger Band, indicating that the price is relatively high compared to the recent past.<br />* The SO is in the middle of its range, indicating a neutral signal.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />Based on the technical analysis of the last closing candle, the stock market is showing signs of an uptrend.

However, the stock has shown some resilience, as it has not fallen below the 120 mark despite the downward pressure.<br /><br />The stock's 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is 116.00479904174804, and the 200-day SMA is 99.61082957292159. The stock is currently trading above both of these moving averages, which is a bullish sign. However, the stock's relative strength index (RSI) is 3.2076278137025156, which is well below the oversold threshold of 30, indicating that the stock may be oversold.<br /><br />The stock's moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is also bearish, with the MACD line crossing below the signal line. This is a bearish signal, indicating that the stock may continue to fall in the near term.<br /><br />In conclusion, the last closing candle suggests that the stock may be oversold and due for a rebound. However, the stock's downward trend and bearish MACD signal suggest that caution is warranted. Investors may want to wait for a confirmation of a trend reversal before initiating a long position. Overall, the stock's technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish outlook.</td></tr><tr class='child-table MRK'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent MRK'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-02</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Date:** 24-07-02<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 127.72000122070312<br /><br />**Volume:** 5,645,000<br /><br />**Trend Analysis:**<br /><br />- The last closing candle's price is higher than the previous day's close, indicating a potential bullish trend.<br />- The volume for the last candle is lower than the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) volume but slightly above the 200-day SMA volume.<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />- The 50-day SMA (125.25059951782227) is below the 200-day SMA (111.83284950256348), which is a bearish signal.<br />- The close price is above both the 50-day and 200-day SMAs, which is a bullish sign.<br />- The 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) (123.76268538653189) is below the 200-day EMA (114.35022477783927), but the close price is above both EMAs.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):**<br /><br />- The RSI for the last candle is 39.337893041219765, which is below the neutral level of 50, indicating that the stock is not overbought.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />- The MACD lines are below the neutral line, suggesting a bearish bias.<br />- The MACD histogram is positive, indicating a potential bullish reversal.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />- The close price is near the upper band, indicating that the stock is overbought in the short term.<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator (SO):**<br /><br />- The SO is at 2.2385581221583095, which is above the overbought level of 2.0, indicating that the stock may be overbought in the short term.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle shows a bullish trend, with the close price above both the 50-day and 200-day SMAs and EMAs.

It's important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results, and investors should always conduct their own research before making investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='child-table SAP'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent SAP'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-02</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**__________________________________________<br /><br />**Trading Day:** 2024-07-02<br /><br />**Closing Price:** 198.5800018310547<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 199.3300018310547<br /><br />**Price Change:** -0.7500018310547<br /><br />**Trading Volume:** 596,300<br /><br />**Average Trading Volume (90 days):** 1,058,611<br /><br />**50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA):** 183.87279933959334<br /><br />**200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA):** 157.37627126807143<br /><br />**50-day SMA > 200-day SMA:** Yes<br /><br />**Price Relative to SMAs:** Below both SMAs<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 39.61342071158989<br /><br />**RSI Threshold (Neutral):** 50<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />* MACD Line (12-26-12): -3.742269142087146<br />* Signal Line (9-day EMA of MACD): -0.707013771367976<br />* Bearish Divergence<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands (20, 2.0):**<br /><br />* Stock Price near Lower Bollinger Band<br />* Stock Price closed near bottom of Bollinger Bands<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator (14, 3, 3):** 3.1380930968912004<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator Threshold (Oversold):** 20<br /><br />**Outlook:** Based on the technical analysis, the last closing candle suggests a neutral to bearish outlook for the stock.

This indicates that the volatility is increasing, which could lead to a significant price move in the near future.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:**<br /><br />The Stochastic Oscillator for the last closing candle is 21.7918033401003, which is below the oversold level of 20. This indicates that the stock is significantly oversold and could potentially see a rebound in the near future.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle on 2024-06-25 is a bearish candle, with the price moving down by approximately 1.22%. The increased trading volume, negative MACD, and oversold conditions based on the RSI and Stochastic Oscillator suggest that the bearish trend could continue in the near future. However, the oversold conditions could also indicate a potential rebound, and investors should monitor the stock closely for any signs of a reversal. It is recommended to remain neutral to bearish on this stock in the short term.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-24</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Technical Analysis Report**------------<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-06-24<br /><br />**Open:** 565.6099853515625<br /><br />**High:** 571.510009765625<br /><br />**Low:** 562.3200073242188<br /><br />**Close:** 565.9500122070312<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* **50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA):** 564.1973999023437<br />* **200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA):** 524.8919505310058<br />* **Close above 50-day and 200-day SMA:** Yes<br />* **50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA):** 564.1744060577126<br />* **200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA):** 536.2956546820026<br />* **Close above 50-day and 200-day EMA:** Yes<br />* **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 43.783681823541535<br />* **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** Positive but close to crossing below the signal line<br />* **Bollinger Bands:** Close near the lower band<br />* **Stochastic Oscillator:** In oversold territory<br />* **Average True Range (ATR):** 13.792332430824152<br /><br />**Analysis:**<br /><br />The last closing candle shows some bullish signals, as the close was higher than the open and both the 50-day and 200-day SMAs were surpassed.

The open price was 174.24, and the high and low prices for the day were 175.30 and 170.45, respectively. This indicates that the stock opened slightly higher than the closing price, reached a high of 175.30 during the day, and dipped to a low of 170.45 before closing.<br /><br />**Moving Averages**<br /><br />The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is 154.97, and the 200-day SMA is 130.37. The stock has been in an overall uptrend, as the 50-day SMA is above the 200-day SMA.

However, the EMA_50 and EMA_200 indicators are both below the closing price, which could indicate a potential trend reversal.

Analysis:<br />-------------<br /><br />The last closing candle indicates a slightly bullish sentiment, as the closing price is higher than the opening price. However, the bullishness is limited, as the candle's range is relatively small and it did not surpass any significant resistance levels.<br /><br />The 50-day and 200-day SMAs are both above the closing price, suggesting a bearish short-term and long-term outlook. The 50-day EMA is also below the closing price, indicating potential bearish momentum. However, the RSI is at 48.44, which is close to the neutral zone (50), and the MACD histogram is slightly above the signal line, indicating a weak bullish signal.<br /><br />The Stochastic Oscillator is in the oversold region, suggesting that a potential rebound might occur. However, the ATR indicates high volatility in the recent past.<br /><br />In conclusion, the last closing candle does not provide a clear indication of a strong bullish or bearish trend. Investors should remain cautious and consider the overall market conditions and other factors before making investment decisions. A neutral to slightly bearish stance might be appropriate, considering the 50-day and 200-day SMAs and EMAs. However, the oversold Stochastic Oscillator and weak bullish MACD signal warrant monitoring for potential bullish opportunities.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-26</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-06-26<br /><br />**Open:** 484.5<br /><br />**High:** 487.44<br /><br />**Low:** 481.5<br /><br />**Close:** 484.04<br /><br />**Analysis:**<br /><br />The closing price of the stock on the given date exhibited a bullish trend, as the closing price was higher than the opening price. However, the price range during this period was relatively small, with a difference of only 5.9 points between the high and low. This indicates a lack of substantial buying or selling pressure.<br /><br />The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) was recorded at 49.6, which is close to the neutral zone of 50. This suggests that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold at the moment.<br /><br />The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) was relatively flat, with the MACD line (12-26-12) at -0.41 and the signal line (9-day EMA of MACD) at -0.35. This indicates that there is no clear trend in the short term.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands, which measure volatility, indicate that the stock has been trading within a narrow range for the past few days. The upper band is at 506.22, the middle band (20-day SMA) is at 492.90, and the lower band is at 479.58. The stock is currently trading near the middle band, which suggests that there is no strong bias towards buying or selling.<br /><br />In summary, the last closing candle was mildly bullish, but the overall market sentiment is neutral. The stock has been trading within a narrow range, and there is no clear trend in the short term. Therefore, it may be advisable to adopt a neutral or cautious stance towards this stock until there are more clear signals of a trend.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-25</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle**<br />---------------------<br /><br />The last closing candle in the provided 90-day price data is for the date **2024-06-25**.
