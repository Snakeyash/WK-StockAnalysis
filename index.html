Despite these dips, buyers intervened, leading to a strong close. This pattern is considered a bullish sign, as it suggests that there is robust demand for the stock at the current price level.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** _Potential for Short-Term Correction_<br /><br />The RSI for the last closing candle was **82.422**, which is above the overbought threshold of 70.

This occurrence indicates that the short-term trend is stronger than the long-term trend.<br /><br />**Conclusion:** _Monitoring Indicators for Potential Correction_<br /><br />Although the RSI suggests that the stock may be overbought in the short term, the strong close, high trading volume, and bullish MACD signal allude to a bullish long-term trend. Therefore, it may be an opportune time to adopt a bullish stance on this stock. However, it's crucial to keep a close eye on the RSI and other indicators for any signs of a potential correction.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-10</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Trading Day:** 2024-06-10<br /><br />**Closing Price:** 193.1199951171875<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 197.1999969482422<br /><br />**Price Range:** 5.070000171661377<br /><br />**50-day SMA:** 184.19919921875<br /><br />**200-day SMA:** 183.87955024719238<br /><br />**50-day SMA > 200-day SMA:** Yes<br /><br />**Closing Price < SMAs:** Yes<br /><br />**RSI:** 35.37226259121181<br /><br />**RSI Neutral Range:** (below 30 is oversold, above 70 is overbought)<br /><br />**MACD Line:** -4.169569472692871<br /><br />**Signal Line:** -0.9242452914327903<br /><br />**Histogram:** Negative<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands (20, 2.0):**<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** Near Lower Band<br /><br />**Bandwidth:** 22.63843558112519<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator (14, 3, 3):**<br /><br />**Value:** 3.3816473821919515<br /><br />**Oversold Range:** (below 20)<br /><br />Based on the provided analysis report, the following facts can be extracted:<br /><br />* The closing price on 2024-06-10 was slightly lower than the opening price, indicating a decrease in the stock price during the day.<br />* The price range was narrow, with a difference of only 5.07 between the high and low prices.<br />* The 50-day SMA was higher than the 200-day SMA, indicating an upward trend.<br />* The closing price was below both SMAs, which might be a bearish signal.<br />* The RSI was in the neutral range, suggesting that the stock was not overbought or oversold.<br />* The MACD indicators were also in the neutral range, but the histogram was negative, indicating a bearish signal.<br />* The Bollinger Bands showed that the last closing price was near the lower band, suggesting that the stock was oversold.<br />* The stochastic oscillator was in the oversold range, suggesting that the stock might be due for a rebound.<br /><br />Therefore, based on the data provided in the analysis report, it is unclear whether the stock market trend is bullish or bearish.

Conversely, the 200-day SMA is at 180.1663, which is below the closing price, indicating a bullish long-term trend.<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />The relative strength index (RSI) is at 35.3723, which is in the neutral territory, neither overbought nor oversold. The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is negative, indicating a bearish short-term trend, but the histogram is starting to flatten out, suggesting a potential trend reversal.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />The Bollinger bands are narrow, indicating low volatility, and the close is near the upper band, suggesting that the stock is overbought. However, the close is also above the upper band, which is a bullish signal.<br /><br />**Average True Range (ATR):**<br /><br />The average true range (ATR) is at 3.3816, which is relatively low, indicating low volatility.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle suggests a bullish outlook, but investors should be cautious due to the bearish short-term trend indicated by the 50-day SMA and the MACD. It may be wise to wait for further confirmation of a trend reversal before making any investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-03</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle Characteristics:**<br /><br />| **Metric**          | **Value**                                 |<br />|---------------------|------------------------------------------|<br />| Open price          | 170.75999450683594                        |<br />| High price         | 174.99000549316406                        |<br />| Low price          | 168.02999877929688                        |<br />| Close price        | 192.97999572753906                        |<br />| Adjusted close price| 192.88719970703124                        |<br />| Volume             | 75115100                                 |<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />| **Indicator**      | **Value**                                 |<br />|--------------------|------------------------------------------|<br />| SMA_50             | 185.46059936523437                        |<br />| SMA_200            | 183.88400024414062                        |<br />| EMA_50             | 184.19919921875                            |<br />| EMA_200            | 180.6367789408375                        |<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):**<br /><br />* RSI: 23.058037345066403<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />| **Indicator**      | **Value**                                 |<br />|--------------------|------------------------------------------|<br />| MACD_12_26_12    | -3.230907618805645                        |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12   | -1.26168184366088                        |<br />| MACDs_12_26_12   | -1.969225775144765                        |<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />| **Indicator**      | **Value**                                 |<br />|--------------------|------------------------------------------|<br />| BBL_20_2.0        | 172.58196282641217                        |<br />| BBM_20_2.0        | 181.77337316694422                        |<br />| BBU_20_2.0        | 190.96478350747628                        |<br />| BBB_20_2.0        | 10.113043709752239                        |<br />| BBP_20_2.0        | -0.13392763558645296                      |<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:**<br /><br />| **Indicator**      | **Value**                                 |<br />|--------------------|------------------------------------------|<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3     | 13.998066026904871                        |<br />| STOCHd_14_3_3     | 3.428094004496773                        |<br /><br />**Average True Range (ATR):**<br /><br />* ATR: 11.295045522425923<br /><br />The last closing candle indicates a strong bullish trend, with the close price significantly higher than the open, high, and low prices.

Therefore, it may be a good time to be bearish or neutral, but not necessarily bullish.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-03</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle Data:** ______________________________________________<br /><br />| Date          | Open      | High       | Low        | Close     | Volume    |<br />| ------------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------- | --------- |<br />| 2024-06-03    | 560.419982 | 562.690002 | 551.020019 | 560.419982 | 2,857,800 |<br /><br />**Bullish Signals:** ______________________________________________________<br /><br />- Closing price higher than opening price<br />- Close price above 50-day EMA<br />- Close price above 200-day EMA<br />- Close price above upper Bollinger Band<br />- %K line above %D line in stochastic oscillator<br /><br />**Neutral Signals:** ______________________________________________________<br /><br />- RSI in neutral zone (45.753296)<br /><br />**Bearish Signals:** ______________________________________________________<br /><br />- MACD line below signal line<br /><br />**Additional Indicators:** _______________________________________________<br /><br />- 50-day SMA: 589.5464<br />- 200-day SMA: 543.1457<br />- 50-day EMA: 583.4724<br />- 200-day EMA: 539.6669<br />- RSI: 45.7532<br />- MACD: -11.0611, -1.9572, -11.0611<br />- Bollinger Bands: 511.0912, 567.249, 623.4068<br />- Stochastic Oscillator: 37.4096, 16.4304<br />- ATR: 37.5316<br /><br />**Conclusion:** __________________________________________________________<br /><br />The last closing candle exhibits bullish signals, including a higher closing price than the opening price, trading volume above the recent average, and the 50-day EMA above the 200-day EMA.

The volume is slightly above average, and the moving averages and MACD indicator are bullish. However, the RSI is above the neutral level, indicating that the stock may be overbought. Therefore, it may be a good time to be cautiously bullish, but it is important to monitor the stock for any signs of a reversal.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-03</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle**<br />---------------------<br /><br />The last closing candle in the provided 90 days of price data has the following values:<br /><br />- Open price: 302.20001220703125<br />- High price: 308.8699951171875<br />- Low price: 302.20001220703125<br />- Close price: 305.2799987792969<br />- Volume: 4828800<br /><br />**Simple Moving Averages (SMA)**<br />--------------------------------<br /><br />- SMA50: 282.8473989868164<br />- SMA200: 233.74059944152833<br /><br />**Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)**<br />-------------------------------------<br /><br />- EMA50: 280.8886665196523<br />- EMA200: 239.17512333351002<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI)**<br />--------------------------------<br /><br />RSI: 55.158605563994165<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**<br />---------------------------------------------<br /><br />- MACD line: 7.95805745598409<br />- Signal line: 1.0229388017163155<br />- Histogram: 6.935118654267774<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands (BB)**<br />-----------------------<br /><br />- BBL: 276.9425946523278<br />- BBM: 296.0100284948082<br />- BBU: 315.0774623372886<br />- BBP: 294.2200012207031<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator (STOCH)**<br />--------------------------------<br /><br />- STOCHk: 88.15655811986916<br />- STOCHd: 7.940671658987886<br /><br />**Average True Range (ATR)**<br />----------------------------<br /><br />ATR: 78.86055231859437<br /><br />**Observations**<br />--------------<br /><br />The last closing candle indicates a slightly bullish trend, as the Close price is higher than the Open price.

However, the RSI is not yet in the oversold zone, suggesting that there may still be room for further downward movement. Investors should exercise caution and consider a bearish strategy for this stock.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-03</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td

However, the Close price is below both SMAs, which may indicate some resistance to further upward movement.<br /><br />The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for this candle is in neutral territory, and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is also in neutral territory.<br /><br />Based on the technical indicators and the data provided, the last closing candle does not provide a clear indication of whether to be bullish or bearish. The bullish sentiment of the candle is somewhat tempered by the fact that the Close price is below both SMAs and the RSI is in neutral territory. However, the slightly above-average volume and the fact that the 50-day SMA is above the 200-day SMA suggest that there may still be some upside potential. Therefore, a neutral stance may be appropriate at this time.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-06</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle**<br />---------------------<br /><br />The last closing candle in the provided 90 days of price data is for the date **2024-06-06**.

This candle was a bearish one, as the close price was lower than the open price of 300.5199890136719. The volume for this candle was 11978100, which was below the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of 300.40559936523437 and the 200-day SMA of 283.76999992370605. This could suggest a lack of conviction among traders and investors.<br /><br />The Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) for this candle were 300.3761999511719 for EMA_50 and 284.74349983215336 for EMA_200. The EMA_50 was above the EMA_200, which was a bullish signal. However, the close price was below both EMAs, which was a bearish signal.<br /><br />The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for this candle was 42.04313127271493, which was in neutral territory as it was above 30 but below 70. This suggested that the stock was not overbought or oversold.<br /><br />The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) for this candle was -2.055484212975898 for the MACD line, -4.033204420329847 for the signal line, and 1.9777202073539493 for the histogram. The MACD line was below the signal line, which was a bearish signal.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands (BB) for this candle were 278.49790558486944 for BBL_20_2.0, 306.7691735923369 for BBM_20_2.0, 335.0404415998044 for BBU_20_2.0, and 18.431622497400564 for BBB_20_2.0. The close price was below the middle band (BBM_20_2.0), which was a bearish signal.<br /><br />The Stochastic Oscillator (STOCH) for this candle was 0.17494986537135843 for the %K line and 0.12278163201549538 for the %D line. The %K line was above the %D line, which was a bullish signal. However, the close price was below both the %K and %D lines, which was a bearish signal.<br /><br />The Average True Range (ATR) for this candle was 10.922593730777265, which was a measure of volatility. This indicated that the stock had been experiencing moderate volatility in recent weeks.<br /><br />In conclusion, the last closing candle was a bearish one, as the close price was lower than the open price. The volume was lower than the recent average, which could suggest a lack of conviction among traders and investors. The EMAs, MACD, and BB all indicated a bearish trend, while the STOCH and ATR suggested moderate volatility. Overall, this candle does not indicate a good time to be bullish, but it is not extremely bearish either. It may be best to adopt a neutral or cautious approach until there are more clear signals in the market.</td></tr><tr class='child-table HD'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent HD'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-12</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report**:**stock ticker*<br /><br />**Market Data for Last Closing Candle (2024-06-12):**<br /><br />| Metric          | Value                         |<br />|------------------|-------------------------------|<br />| Open             | 347.0299987792969              |<br />| High             | 350.489990234375              |<br />| Low              | 343.05999755859375              |<br />| Close            | 344.1400146484375              |<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />1. **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** The 14-day RSI is 6.63, which is below the neutral level of 50.

The RSI is close to neutral, and the MACD lines are positive but close to crossing. The Bollinger Band width is relatively high, indicating increased volatility.

This candle has a small real body and a long upper wick, indicating increased selling pressure. The volume for this candle was significantly higher than previous candles.<br /><br />The 50-day SMA is 120.53339935302735, and the 200-day SMA is 114.47749965667725.

However, the long upper wick and high volume suggest that the bullish trend may be coming to an end.<br /><br />The RSI for the last candle is 72.19754216851985, which is above the overbought threshold of 70. This indicates that the stock may be overbought and due for a correction. The MACD is also bullish, with the 12-day EMA above the 26-day EMA and the MACD histogram above the signal line.

However, the close above the 50-day and 200-day SMAs and the bullish MACD are still bullish indicators. Therefore, it may be wise to adopt a neutral stance and wait for further confirmation of the trend direction. A continuation of the uptrend would require a break above the high of the last candle, while a bearish reversal would be confirmed by a break below the low of the last candle.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-11</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 24-06-11<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 123.88999938964844<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 124.05000305175781<br /><br />**High:** 124.83000183105469<br /><br />**Low:** 122.29000091552734<br /><br />**Volume:** 1,047,3971<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| **Indicator** | **Value** |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| 50-day SMA | 112.85280023696295 |<br />| 200-day SMA | 108.42224575209003 |<br />| RSI | 69.18697742021958 |<br />| MACD Line | 2.235322777161016 |<br />| Signal Line | 1.4703407741357533 |<br />| Upper Bollinger Band | 105.74280082835665 |<br />| Middle Bollinger Band | 115.10944166329872 |<br />| Lower Bollinger Band | 124.4760824982408 |<br />| %K Line | 3.304425255446616 |<br />| %D Line | 3.2726806379398266 |<br />| Slow %D Line | 3.191644004281212 |<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />The last closing candle for the 90-day price data from the daily chart on 2024-06-11 exhibits a bullish sentiment.

Price Action<br /><br />The last closing candle indicates an uptrend in the recent past, as the Close price is higher than both the 50-day and 200-day SMAs. The RSI is above 50, indicating that the stock is not overbought. The MACD is positive, and the histogram is above the signal line, suggesting a bullish phase. However, the Stochastic %K is above the %D, indicating that the stock is overbought, and the price is near the upper Bollinger Band. The Average True Range Realized 14 is relatively low, suggesting decreasing price volatility.<br /><br />In summary, the stock price is in a bullish trend, but it is overbought and near the upper Bollinger Band. This may indicate a good time to take profits or consider a short-term bearish position. However, the overall trend remains bullish. It is essential to consider other factors, such as market conditions and company fundamentals, before making any investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-06</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle Data**<br />---------------------------<br /><br />| **Parameter**          | **Value**                                                 |<br />|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|<br />| Open price             | 122.87999725341797                                         |<br />| High price            | 124.2699966430664                                         |<br />| Low price             | 120.51000213623047                                         |<br />| Close price           | 122.62999725341797                                         |<br />| Volume                | 5730772                                                  |<br /><br />**Moving Averages**<br />------------------<br /><br />| **Indicator**         | **Value**                                                 |<br />|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|<br />| SMA_50              | 114.60819946289062                                         |<br />| SMA_200             | 112.14314964294434                                         |<br />| EMA_50              | 114.95685373153387                                         |<br />| EMA_200             | 107.99550408188634                                         |<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI)**<br />--------------------------------<br /><br />| **Parameter**   | **Value**                                                 |<br />|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|<br />| RSI             | 50.46865207576881                                          |<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**<br />---------------------------------------------<br /><br />| **Indicator**      | **Value**                                                 |<br />|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|<br />| MACD_12_26_12   | 0.25273926909764555                                        |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12  | 0.4990874771516544                                        |<br />| MACDs_12_26_12  | 0.3044384390770821                                        |<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands (BB)**<br />-----------------------<br /><br />| **Indicator**      | **Value**                                                 |<br />|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|<br />| BBL_20_2.0       | 108.24516892817677                                         |<br />| BBM_20_2.0       | 112.42763135399713                                         |<br />| BBU_20_2.0       | 116.61009377981749                                         |<br />| BBB_20_2.0       | 7.440274913648552                                          |<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator (STOCH)**<br />--------------------------------<br /><br />| **Indicator**      | **Value**                                                 |<br />|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3   | 2.2358730551007526                                         |<br />| STOCHd_14_3_3   | 79.78443239903913                                          |<br /><br />**Average True Range (ATR)**<br />---------------------------<br /><br />| **Parameter**   | **Value**                                                 |<br />|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|<br />| ATR             | 2.449007626149004                                          |<br /><br />**Conclusion**<br />------------<br /><br />The last closing candle is a bullish candle, as the closing price is higher than the opening price.

This indicates a bearish trend in the market during this period.<br /><br />The trading volume for the last session was 6,276,700, which is slightly above the 90-day average volume.

The MACD indicators are bullish, but the Stochastic Oscillator is not extremely high, so it does not necessarily indicate an overbought condition. The ATRr_14 is relatively high, indicating high volatility. Therefore, it may be prudent to wait for further price action before making a decision.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-05</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle Values**<br />----------------------------<br /><br />Open: 247.94000244140625<br />High: 251.47999572753906<br />Low: 242.82000732421875<br />Close: 244.32000732421875<br /><br />**Volume**<br />--------<br /><br />347400<br /><br />**Moving Averages**<br />------------------<br /><br />50-day SMA: 220.11339969482422<br />200-day SMA: 185.4235994720459<br /><br />50-day EMA: 217.854599609375<br />200-day EMA: 184.90524940490724<br /><br />**Technical Indicators**<br />-----------------------<br /><br />14-day RSI: 45.12289180349798<br />50-day EMA (MACD): 10.68847925989678<br />200-day EMA (MACD): 0.7464333654385946<br />MACD Line: 10.68847925989678<br />Signal Line: 0.7464333654385946<br />Histogram: 9.942045894458186<br /><br />Bollinger Bands<br />--------------<br /><br />Upper Band (BBU): 251.59729759180635<br />Band (BBM): 234.78849523174682<br />Lower Band (BBB): 217.59729759180635<br />Band Width (BBP): 34.20000076293945<br /><br />Stochastic Oscillator<br />---------------------<br /><br />K: 89.84427832755092<br />D: 91.6742052850088<br /><br />**14-day Average True Range (ATR)**<br />----------------------------------<br /><br />4.122891803497984<br /><br />**Observations**<br />--------------<br /><br />The last closing candle is a bearish candle, as the closing price is lower than the opening price.

However, it is important to note that the stock is overbought and a correction may be due in the near future.

This bullish sign suggests that buyers were more aggressive than sellers during the trading session.<br /><br />**High and Low Prices:** The high price for the last candle was the same as the open and close price, at **599.030029296875**. The low price was **591.0399780273438**. The small real body in the candlestick chart indicates indecision in the market, but the higher high price suggests that buyers remain in control.<br /><br />**Moving Averages:** The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) was **556.9485998535156**, and the 200-day SMA was **529.5327531823114**.

The higher close price, higher high price, and the stock price being above both short-term and long-term moving averages are all positive signs. However, the RSI being above 50 and the MACD histogram being positive indicate that the stock is overbought, which should be monitored for potential signs of a trend reversal. Overall, a bullish stance is recommended.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-04</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Technical Analysis Report**------------<br /><br />**Closing Data:** <br />- Date: 2024-06-04<br />- Open: 591.1599731445312<br />- High: 594.530029296875<br />- Low: 588.9500122070312<br />- Close: 590.7000122070312<br />- Adj Close: 590.7000122070312<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br />- SMA_50: 550.32580078125<br />- SMA_200: 520.1979512023926<br />- EMA_50: 548.6590142423663<br />- EMA_200: 528.848057504299<br /><br />**Oscillators:**<br />- RSI: 74.23949760745424<br />- MACD: 10.551889317244672 (MACD line), 3.2717081626540256 (signal line), 7.280181154590647 (histogram)<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br />- BBL_20_2.0: 536.889605989655<br />- BBM_20_2.0: 565.549192621165<br />- BBU_20_2.0: 594.2087792526751<br />- BBB_20_2.0: 584.889605989655<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:**<br />- %K line: 10.03371808820964<br />- %D line: 0.9527421786032169<br /><br />**Average True Range:** 94.14601925712589<br /><br />**Observations:**<br />- The closing price is above both the SMA_50 and SMA_200, indicating an uptrend.<br />- The RSI is above 70, indicating an overbought condition.<br />- The MACD line is above the signal line, suggesting a bullish trend.<br />- The Bollinger Bands are expanding, indicating increased volatility.<br />- The Stochastic Oscillator %K line is below the %D line, indicating a potential oversold condition.<br />- The ATR is high, indicating increased volatility.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br />The technical analysis suggests a bullish trend, but the RSI indicates that the stock may be overbought.

However, they were not successful in maintaining the momentum, and the price started to decline. The low of 167.4199981689453 is the lowest price of the day, indicating that the bears were successful in pulling the price downwards. The close price of 170.66000366210938 is lower than the open price, indicating that the bears were in control during the period. This is further confirmed by the fact that the close price is near the low of the day.<br /><br />The volume for the last closing candle is 64354619, which is slightly above the 90-day average volume.
