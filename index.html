However, the 50-day SMA is below the 200-day SMA, which is a bearish "death cross."<br />- The RSI is in the neutral range, suggesting that the stock is not overbought or oversold.<br />- The MACD is negative, with the 12-day EMA below the 26-day EMA and the signal line, indicating a bearish trend.<br />- The Bollinger Bands are relatively wide, with the stock trading near the lower band, suggesting that it may be oversold and due for a rebound.

The open price for the same day was slightly lower than the previous day's closing price. The high for the day was the same as the previous day's closing price, while the low was lower.<br /><br />The 50-day SMA and 200-day SMA are currently at 205.29 and 189.26, respectively. The stock is trading above both its short-term and long-term moving averages, which is typically a bullish sign. However, the stock's EMAs tell a different story. The 50-day EMA is 210.0, and the 200-day EMA is 194.39, indicating that the stock's short-term trend is downward, while its long-term trend is still upward.<br /><br />The stock's RSI is 48.57, which is in neutral territory and does not provide a clear signal. However, the stock's MACD is negative, with a value of -1.54, indicating that the stock's short-term trend is downward.<br /><br />The stock's Bollinger Bands are somewhat bearish. The stock is currently trading near the lower end of its Bollinger Band, indicating that it may be oversold. However, the stock's BandWidth (BW) is relatively narrow, suggesting that the stock's volatility is low.<br /><br />Finally, the stock's Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is -0.12, indicating that there is more selling pressure than buying pressure in the stock. This is a bearish sign.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle suggests that the stock may be experiencing some downward pressure in the short term, as evidenced by its lower close and negative MACD and CMF values. However, the stock's long-term trend is still upward, and it is currently trading above both its short-term and long-term moving averages. Therefore, a neutral to slightly bearish stance may be appropriate at this time. However, investors should conduct their own research and consider their own risk tolerance and investment goals before making any investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-17</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Closing Price** __________________________________________<br />The stock closed at 228.88 on 2024-07-17.<br /><br />**Percentage Change** ______________________________________<br />This represents a decrease of 2.48% from the previous close of 234.82.<br /><br />**Open, High, and Low Prices** ______________________________<br />Open price: 231.46<br />High: 232.33<br />Low: 226.64<br /><br />**Moving Averages** _______________________________________<br />50-day SMA: 204.44<br />200-day SMA: 186.87<br />50-day EMA: 203.53<br />200-day EMA: 186.58<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI)** _____________________________<br />RSI for the last closing candle: 4.91<br />Neutral zone: 30-70<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)** _______________<br />MACD line (12-26-12): below signal line<br />Histogram: negative<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands** ________________________________________<br />Stock price below lower band: bearish signal<br />Bandwidth: 5.15<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator (14,3,3)** _____________________________<br />Current value: 8.1<br />Strong bearish signal: below 20<br /><br />**Technical Indicators Summary** _____________________________<br />Based on the last closing candle's data and technical indicators, the stock market is showing bearish signals.

The upper wick of 0.99 and lower wick of 1.40 suggest that the market tested both resistance and support levels during the period but ultimately closed near the high of the day.<br /><br />The bullish engulfing pattern is often interpreted as a sign of a potential trend reversal. This pattern suggests that the bulls have taken control of the market and that the price may continue to rise.<br /><br />However, it is essential to note that technical analysis should not be used in isolation and should be complemented with other forms of analysis, such as fundamental analysis. While the last closing candle is a bullish signal, it does not guarantee that the price will continue to rise.

The Bollinger Bands indicate that the stock's price is near the middle band, which is a neutral signal.<br /><br />Investors should exercise caution and consider other factors before making any investment decisions based on this analysis.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-16</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-16<br /><br />**Key Indicators:**<br /><br />| **Indicator** | **Value** |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| Open | 564.6 |<br />| High | 570.1 |<br />| Low | 562.08 |<br />| Close | **566.54** |<br />| Adj Close | 566.54 |<br />| Volume | 1,538,500 |<br />| SMA_50 | 504.71 |<br />| SMA_200 | 545.26 |<br />| EMA_50 | 505.32 |<br />| EMA_200 | 545.24 |<br />| RSI_14 | **67.51** |<br />| MACD_12_26_12 | 14.49 |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12 | 5.02 |<br />| MACDs_12_26_12 | 14.49 |<br />| BBL_20_2.0 | 557.63 |<br />| BBM_20_2.0 | 565.71 |<br />| BBU_20_2.0 | 573.85 |<br />| BBB_20_2.0 | 551.45 |<br />| BBP_20_2.0 | 566.54 |<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3 | 94.56 |<br />| STOCHd_14_3_3 | 90.24 |<br />| ATRr_14 | 12.41 |<br /><br />**Analysis:**<br /><br />The last closing candle shows the following qualities:<br /><br />* Open: 564.6<br />* High: 570.1<br />* Low: 562.08<br />* Close: **566.54**<br />* Adj Close: 566.54<br />* Volume: 1,538,500<br />* SMA_50: 504.71<br />* SMA_200: 545.26<br />* EMA_50: 505.32<br />* EMA_200: 545.24<br />* RSI_14: **67.51**<br />* MACD_12_26_12: 14.49<br />* MACDh_12_26_12: 5.02<br />* MACDs_12_26_12: 14.49<br />* BBL_20_2.0: 557.63<br />* BBM_20_2.0: 565.71<br />* BBU_20_2.0: 573.85<br />* BBB_20_2.0: 551.45<br />* BBP_20_2.0: 566.54<br />* STOCHk_14_3_3: 94.56<br />* STOCHd_14_3_3: 90.24<br />* ATRr_14: 12.41<br /><br />**Technical Analysis:**<br /><br />Based on the provided data, the following technical indicators were calculated:<br /><br />1. Close: The closing price is 566.54, which is higher than the previous day's close.<br />2. Volume: The volume is lower than the previous day, indicating decreased interest in the stock.<br />3. SMA_50 and SMA_200: The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is below the 200-day SMA, which is a bearish sign. However, the closing price is above the 50-day SMA.<br />4. EMA_50 and EMA_200: The 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) is below the 200-day EMA, but the closing price is above the 50-day EMA.<br />5.

The stock price is higher than the previous day, and the MACD is positive, which are bullish signs. However, the RSI and Stochastic Oscillator indicate that the stock is overbought, which could lead to a bearish reversal. Additionally, the volume is lower than the previous day, which could be a bearish sign.<br /><br />Therefore, it is recommended to be cautious and monitor the stock closely for further developments. It may be a good idea to wait for a pullback before entering a long position. Alternatively, shorting the stock could be considered if the bearish signals become more pronounced. Overall, a neutral to slightly bearish stance is recommended based on the last closing candle.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-15</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-16<br /><br />**Stock Closing Price:** 565.71<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 560.23<br /><br />**Trading Volume:** 1,884,973<br /><br />**50-Day and 200-Day Simple Moving Averages (SMA):**<br /><br />| SMA Period | Value |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| 50-day | 502.91 |<br />| 200-day | 544.94 |<br /><br />**50-Day and 200-Day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA):**<br /><br />| EMA Period | Value |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| 50-day | 502.91 |<br />| 200-day | 544.94 |<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI) - 14-day:** 67.46<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) - 12, 26, and 9-day:**<br /><br />| MACD Line | Signal Line |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| 14.82 | -0.28 |<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands - 20-day:**<br /><br />| Upper Band | Lower Band | BBW |<br />| --- | --- | --- |<br />| 588.46 | 553.55 | 12.75 |<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator - 14-day:** 66.12<br /><br />**Stochastic %K and %D:**<br /><br />| %K | %D |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| 66.12 | 63.58 |<br /><br />**Analysis:**<br /><br />The stock closed at 565.71 on 2024-07-15, which is higher than the opening price of 560.23, indicating a potential bullish sentiment. However, the trading volume for this period was relatively low at 1,884,973, which could suggest a lack of conviction among buyers.<br /><br />The stock's SMA and EMA for the 50 and 200-day periods are 502.91 and 544.94, respectively. The stock is currently trading above both its SMA and EMA, which is typically a bullish sign. However, the 50-day EMA is starting to flatten, which could indicate a potential slowdown in the stock's upward momentum.<br /><br />The stock's RSI for the 14-day period is 67.46, which is above the neutral level of 50, indicating that the stock is currently overbought. This could suggest that the stock may be due for a correction in the near term.<br /><br />The stock's MACD for the 12, 26, and 9-day periods is 14.82, -0.28, and -18.28, respectively. The MACD line is above the signal line, indicating a bullish trend. However, the MACD histogram is starting to narrow, which could suggest a potential slowdown in the stock's upward momentum.<br /><br />The stock's Bollinger Bands for the 20-day period show that the stock is currently trading near the upper band, indicating that the stock is overbought. The Bollinger Band Width (BBW) for the 20-day period is 12.75, which is relatively high, indicating that the stock has been experiencing high volatility.<br /><br />The stock's Stochastic Oscillator for the 14-day period is 66.12, which is above the neutral level of 50, indicating that the stock is currently overbought. The Stochastic %K line is above the Stochastic %D line, indicating a bullish trend. However, the Stochastic %K line is starting to flatten, which could suggest a potential slowdown in the stock's upward momentum.<br /><br />In summary, the last closing candle suggests a potential bullish sentiment, with the stock trading above both its SMA and EMA. However, the stock's RSI, MACD, and Stochastic Oscillator all indicate that the stock is currently overbought, which could suggest a potential correction in the near term. Additionally, the stock's low trading volume and narrowing MACD histogram could suggest a potential slowdown in the stock's upward momentum. Therefore, it may be advisable to adopt a neutral to slightly bearish stance in the near term.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-12</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td

Traders may consider going long on the stock with a stop loss below the lower Bollinger Band, while investors may want to wait for a more significant reversal before entering a long position.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-17</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**__________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-18<br /><br />**Stock Closing Price:** 159.43<br /><br />**Change from Opening Price:** -3.56<br /><br />**High for the Day:** 169.8<br /><br />**Low for the Day:** 159.37<br /><br />**Previous Closing Price:** 177.55<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />| **Moving Average** | **Value** |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| 50-day SMA | 163.79 |<br />| 200-day SMA | 152.02 |<br />| 50-day EMA | 162.98 |<br />| 200-day EMA | 151.34 |<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| **Technical Indicator** | **Reading** |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| RSI | 3.56 |<br />| MACD | Bearish |<br />| Bollinger Bands | Stock is trading near lower band, below middle band |<br />| Stochastic Oscillator | Bearish, %K line crossed below %D line |<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />The stock closed at 159.43 on 2024-07-17, which is a decrease of 3.56 from the opening price of 169.8. The high for the day was also 169.8, and the low was 159.37. The stock's significant decrease from the previous day's close of 177.55 could be a bearish signal.<br /><br />The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is 163.79, and the 200-day SMA is 152.02. The 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) is 162.98, and the 200-day EMA is 151.34. The stock is currently trading below both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which could be a bearish signal.<br /><br />The stock's relative strength index (RSI) is 3.56, which is a very low value, indicating that the stock is oversold.

However, it's important to note that the RSI is a momentum indicator and should be used in conjunction with other technical indicators.<br /><br />The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator is also bearish, with the MACD line crossing below the signal line. This is a bearish signal, as it indicates that the stock's momentum is decreasing.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands, which are a volatility indicator, show that the stock is currently trading near the lower band, indicating low volatility. The stock's current price is also below the middle band, which could be a bearish signal.<br /><br />The stock's stochastic oscillator is also bearish, with the %K line crossing below the %D line. This is a bearish signal, as it indicates that the stock's momentum is decreasing.<br /><br />Based on this analysis, the last closing candle may indicate a good time to be bearish on the stock. The stock's significant decrease from the previous day's close, low RSI value, bearish MACD and stochastic oscillator readings, and trading below both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages all suggest that the stock may continue to decrease in value. However, it's important to note that technical analysis is not a guarantee of future performance, and other factors such as fundamental analysis and market conditions should also be considered.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-16</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report******<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-16<br /><br />**Open:** 179.69<br />**High:** 179.75<br />**Low:** 174.53<br />**Close:** 177.55<br />**Adj Close:** 177.55<br />**Volume:** 40579000<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* SMA_50: 163.61<br />* SMA_200: 151.74<br />* EMA_50: 163.61<br />* EMA_200: 151.74<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* RSI_14: 51.64<br />* MACD_12_26_12: -0.04<br />* MACDh_12_26_12: 0.07<br />* MACDs_12_26_12: 7.47<br />* BBL_20_2.0: 151.64<br />* BBM_20_2.0: 171.15<br />* BBU_20_2.0: 190.67<br />* BBB_20_2.0: 163.61<br />* BBP_20_2.0: 0.66<br />* STOCHk_14_3_3: 77.36<br />* STOCHd_14_3_3: 81.62<br />* ATRr_14: 6.79<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />The last closing candle on 2024-07-16 had the following price values: open - 179.69, high - 179.75, low - 174.53, close - 177.55, and adjusted close - 177.55.

The open price was **1074.52**, the high was **1077.05**, the low was **1060.74**, and the close was **1068.19**.<br /><br />**Characteristics of the Last Closing Candle:**<br /><br />This candle can be characterized as a small real body with a slight upper shadow and no lower shadow, which is also known as a "doji." A doji indicates indecision or a balance between buyers and sellers, as the open and close prices are very close to each other.<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />1. **Simple Moving Averages (SMA):**<br />   - 50-day SMA: **999.06**<br />   - 200-day SMA: **845.92**<br />   The close price is above both the short-term and long-term moving averages, which can be interpreted as a bullish sign. However, the close is relatively close to the 50-day SMA, suggesting that the stock might face some resistance at this level.<br />2. **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA):**<br />   - 50-day EMA: **1002.86**<br />   - 200-day EMA: **852.4**<br />   Similar to the SMAs, the close price is above both the short-term and long-term EMAs, indicating a bullish trend.<br />3. **Relative Strength Index (RSI):**<br />   - 14-day RSI: **48.29**<br />   The 14-day RSI is close to the neutral level of 50. This indicates that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, and there is no clear momentum in either direction.<br />4. **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br />   - MACD line: **-1.52**<br />   - Signal line: **-1.47**<br />   The MACD line is below the signal line, which can be interpreted as a bearish sign. However, the difference between the two lines is minimal, suggesting that the bearish signal is weak.<br />5. **Bollinger Bands:**<br />   - The close price is near the lower Bollinger Band, which can be seen as a bearish sign. However, the doji pattern indicates indecision, so this might not be a strong signal.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />Based on the analysis of the last closing candle and the relevant technical indicators, it is difficult to make a clear determination of whether the stock is a good buy or not. The doji pattern suggests indecision, and the close price is close to the 50-day SMA and near the lower Bollinger Band, which can be interpreted as bearish signals. However, the close price is above both the short-term and long-term moving averages, indicating a bullish trend.<br /><br />Given the mixed signals, it might be best to adopt a neutral or cautiously bullish stance. Investors could consider waiting for further confirmation of the trend before making a decision.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-15</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-16<br /><br />**Stock Closing Price:** 1063.63<br /><br />**Change from Previous Close:** -3.13%<br /><br />**50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA):** 1002.01<br /><br />**200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA):** 932.87<br /><br />**50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA):** 1000.7<br /><br />**200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA):** 939.01<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 49.29<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** -1.46<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />* Lower Band: 947.53<br />* Middle Band: 971.77<br />* Upper Band: 996.01<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:** 21.05<br /><br />**Analysis:**<br /><br />The stock closed at 1063.63 on 2024-07-15, which represents a decrease of 3.13% compared to the previous close.

The high of the candle is 317.0, and the low is 313.23.<br /><br />The stock has been in an overall uptrend, with the 50-day SMA (Simple Moving Average) at 300.59 and the 200-day SMA at 283.95, both of which are below the current price.

However, the short-term momentum is bearish, as indicated by the MACD. The overall trend remains bullish, with the stock trading above its moving averages. The RSI and Stochastic Oscillator suggest that the stock might be due for a correction or a reversal. Therefore, it is advisable to be cautiously optimistic and consider a neutral to slightly bullish stance.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr class='parent-row inconclusive inconclusive_daily' id='CEG'><td>CEG</td><td>Constellation Energy Corporation Common Stock</td><td>2024-07-19</td><td>neutral</td></tr><tr class='explanation-table CEG'><td colspan='4'>I.

Therefore, it is advisable to be cautious and monitor the stock's performance closely before making any investment decisions.

The RSI 14 is at 49.48, indicating a neutral position, neither overbought nor oversold.<br />3. The MACD (12, 26, 9) is -2.29, which is bearish.<br />4. The Stochastic Oscillator (14, 3, 3) has both %K and %D lines at 65.0, which is bullish. However, this might be a short-term bullish signal, and the overall bearish trend should be considered.<br />5. The closing price is near the lower Bollinger Band (194.84), suggesting that the stock is oversold and might experience a rebound.<br /><br />**Recommendation:**<br /><br />Considering the bearish indicators (closing price below moving averages, bearish MACD, and oversold position) and the slightly bullish Stochastic Oscillator, it might be wise to adopt a neutral-to-bearish stance for the short term.

The stock is currently trading near the middle band, indicating a potential consolidation phase.<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:**<br /><br />The Stochastic Oscillator for the last closing candle is 69.32 for the %K line and 53.07 for the %D line. This is a bearish signal, as the %K line has crossed below the %D line.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />Based on the analysis, the last closing candle suggests a neutral to bearish outlook for the stock. While the long-term trend is bullish, the short-term trend is bearish, with the stock trading below the 50-day SMA and EMA. The bearish signals from the MACD and Stochastic Oscillator also support this outlook. However, the stock's recovery towards the end of the day and its trading near the middle Bollinger Band suggest a potential consolidation phase. Therefore, it may be wise to adopt a cautious approach and wait for further confirmation of the trend before making any investment decisions.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr class='parent-row inconclusive inconclusive_daily' id='CRM'><td>CRM</td><td>Salesforce Inc.

The following metrics were recorded for this candle:<br /><br />- Open: 371.67<br />- High: 383.57<br />- Low: 290.1<br />- Close: 304.96<br />- Adj Close: 304.96<br />- Volume: 98166333<br />- SMA 50: 283.49<br />- SMA 200: 200.24<br />- EMA 50: 283.49<br />- EMA 200: 200.24<br />- RSI 14: 46.49<br />- MACD 12 26 12: 24.81<br />- MACDh 12 26 12: -3.81<br />- MACDs 12 26 12: 28.62<br />- BBL 20 2.0: 272.05<br />- BBM 20 2.0: 334.59<br />- BBU 20 2.0: 397.13<br />- BBB 20 2.0: 37.38<br />- BBP 20 2.0: 0.26<br />- STOCHk 14 3 3: 64.38<br />- STOCHd 14 3 3: 81.0<br />- ATRr 14: 31.67<br /><br />The open price of 371.67 is the highest open price in the entire price data range, indicating a strong bullish trend in the recent past. However, the close price of 304.96 is significantly lower than the open price, indicating a reversal of this trend in the most recent week. This is further supported by the fact that the close price is lower than both the 50 and 200 day moving averages (SMA 50 and SMA 200), as well as the 50 and 200 day exponential moving averages (EMA 50 and EMA 200).<br /><br />The relative strength index (RSI 14) for the last closing candle is 46.49, which is close to the neutral midpoint of 50. This suggests that the stock is not overbought or oversold, and that the recent price movements may be due to fundamental factors rather than market sentiment.<br /><br />The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicators also suggest a bearish trend in the most recent week. The MACD line (MACD 12 26 12) is above the signal line (MACDh 12 26 12), indicating a bullish trend, but the MACD line is also decreasing, indicating that this trend may be weakening. The MACD histogram (MACDs 12 26 12) is also negative, further suggesting a bearish trend.<br /><br />The Bollinger bands (BBL 20 2.0, BBM 20 2.0, BBU 20 2.0, and BBB 20 2.0) also suggest a bearish trend. The close price is below the lower Bollinger band (BBL 20 2.0), indicating that the stock is currently undervalued. The Bollinger band width (BBP 20 2.0) is also very low, indicating low volatility in the stock price.<br /><br />The stochastic oscillator (STOCHk 14 3 3 and STOCHd 14 3 3) also suggests a bearish trend. The STOCHk line is below the STOCHd line, indicating a downtrend, and both lines are below the neutral midpoint of 50.<br /><br />Overall, the last closing candle suggests a bearish trend in the stock price. While there was a strong bullish trend in the recent past, the most recent week has seen a significant reversal, with the close price significantly lower than the open price. The various technical indicators also suggest a bearish trend, with the stock currently undervalued and low volatility.</td></tr><tr class='child-table CRWD'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent CRWD'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-19</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-19<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 304.96<br /><br />**Open:** 294.51<br /><br />**High:** 316.75<br /><br />**Low:** 290.1<br /><br />**Adj Close:** 304.96<br /><br />**Volume:** 418,166,760<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| **Indicator** | **Value** |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| SMA_50 | 358.16 |<br />| SMA_200 | 289.25 |<br />| EMA_50 | 356.95 |<br />| EMA_200 | 296.14 |<br />| RSI_14 | 24.6 |<br />| MACD_12_26_12 | -5.46 |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12 | -10.4 |<br />| MACDs_12_26_12 | 4.94 |<br />| BBL_20_2.0 | 325.05 |<br />| BBM_20_2.0 | 364.93 |<br />| BBU_20_2.0 | 404.81 |<br />| BBB_20_2.0 | 21.86 |<br />| BBP_20_2.0 | -0.25 |<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3 | 11.14 |<br />| STOCHd_14_3_3 | 14.32 |<br />| ATRr_14 | 16.48 |<br /><br />**Technical Analysis:**<br /><br />1.

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is negative, with the signal line crossing below the MACD line, which is a bearish sign.<br />6. The Bollinger Bands show that the closing price is near the lower Bollinger Band, which could indicate a reversion to the mean and a potential bullish sign.<br />7. The Stochastic Oscillator is at 11.14, which is below 20, indicating oversold conditions.

However, the oversold conditions suggested by the RSI and Stochastic Oscillator could indicate a potential rebound in the near future. Therefore, it is advisable to be cautious and monitor the market closely for any signs of a reversal. A neutral to slightly bearish stance may be appropriate at this time, with a focus on risk management and protective stop-loss orders.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-18</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle Analysis**<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-18<br /><br />**Technical Details:**<br /><br />| **Metric**          | **Value** |<br />|---------------------|-----------|<br />| Open                | 351.74    |<br />| High                | 352.2     |<br />| Low                 | 336.34    |<br />| Close               | 343.05    |<br />| Adj Close           | 343.05    |<br />| Volume             | 4550700   |<br />| SMA_50              | 358.31    |<br />| SMA_200             | 288.58    |<br />| EMA_50              | 359.07    |<br />| EMA_200             | 296.05    |<br />| RSI_14              | 35.14     |<br />| MACD_12_26_12       | -0.34     |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12      | 6.84      |<br />| MACDs_12_26_12      | -7.17     |<br />| BBL_20_2.0          | 347.33    |<br />| BBM_20_2.0          | 371.24    |<br />| BBU_20_2.0          | 395.15    |<br />| BBB_20_2.0          | 322.41    |<br />| BBP_20_2.0          | 354.94    |<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3       | 2.33      |<br />| STOCHd_14_3_3       | -5.81     |<br />| ATRr_14             | 8.14      |<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />1.

The 50-day EMA is 355.6, while the 200-day EMA is 314.38.

Therefore, it may be prudent to wait for a pullback before entering a long position, or to consider a bearish position if the price shows signs of breaking down through the moving averages or the lower Bollinger band.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-15</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**__________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-15<br /><br />**Closing Price:** 215.72<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 214.4<br /><br />**Price Change:** 1.32 (0.61%)<br /><br />**High of the Day:** 216.32<br /><br />**Low of the Day:** 213.43<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA): 207.12<br />* 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA): 198.24<br />* 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA): 206.71<br />* 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA): 198.1<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 63.7<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />* MACD Line (12-26-9): 2.03<br />* Signal Line (9-26-9): 1.78<br />* Histogram: 0.25<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />* Upper Band: 218.55<br />* Middle Band: 213.83<br />* Lower Band: 209.11<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:** 94.0<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />* The stock closed above both the short-term and long-term moving averages, indicating a bullish trend.<br />* The 50-day SMA recently crossed below the 200-day SMA, which can be considered a bearish signal.<br />* The RSI is slightly above the neutral midpoint, suggesting an uptrend.<br />* The MACD indicators are slightly positive, indicating short-term momentum is stronger than long-term momentum.<br />* The stock is trading near the upper Bollinger Band, which can be seen as a bullish sign.<br />* The stochastic oscillator is above the overbought threshold, suggesting the stock may be overbought and due for a correction.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr class='parent-row sell sell_daily' id='INTC'><td>INTC</td><td>Intel Corporation Common Stock</td><td>2024-07-19</td><td>bearish</td></tr><tr class='explanation-table INTC'><td colspan='4'>**Weekly Stock Market Analysis**---------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Data:** 2024-07-15<br /><br />| **Metric**          | **Value** |<br />|---------------------|-----------|<br />| Open                | 34.7      |<br />| High                | 37.16     |<br />| Low                 | 32.85     |<br />| Close               | 32.98     |<br />| Adj Close           | 32.98     |<br />| Volume             | 403,243,747|<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />| **MA**          | **Value** |<br />|----------------|-----------|<br />| SMA 50         | 38.28     |<br />| SMA 200        | 42.45     |<br />| EMA 50         | 38.33     |<br />| EMA 200        | 40.26     |<br /><br />**Trend Indicators:**<br /><br />| **Indicator** | **Value** |<br />|--------------|----------|<br />| RSI 14       | 43.43     |<br />| MACD 12 26 12 | -2.18    |<br />| MACDh 12 26 12 | -0.08   |<br />| MACDs 12 26 12 | 0.43    |<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />| **BB**          | **Value** |<br />|----------------|-----------|<br />| BBL 20 2.0   | 24.57     |<br />| BBM 20 2.0   | 34.3      |<br />| BBU 20 2.0   | 44.03     |<br />| BBB 20 2.0   | 36.26     |<br />| BBP 20 2.0   | 34.44     |<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:**<br /><br />| **STOCH** | **Value** |<br />|-----------|----------|<br />| STOCHk 14 3 3 | 36.83    |<br />| STOCHd 14 3 3 | 24.04    |<br /><br />**Average True Range:**<br /><br />| **ATR** | **Value** |<br />|---------|----------|<br />| ATRr 14 | 2.65     |<br /><br />**Summary:**<br /><br />The last closing candle indicates a bearish trend, with the price closing below major moving averages and negative MACD and RSI readings.

This could be interpreted as a bullish signal, as the stock may rebound in the near future.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle presented a mixed picture, with both bullish and bearish signals. The bearish short-term outlook was suggested by the stock price being below the SMA_50 and EMA_50, as well as the MACD signal line being below the MACD line. However, the bullish long-term outlook was indicated by the stock price being above the SMA_200 and EMA_200. The RSI_14 was close to the neutral zone, and the Stochastic Oscillator was in the oversold territory, which could be interpreted as bullish signals.<br /><br />Therefore, it may be prudent to adopt a neutral stance, carefully monitoring the stock's performance and awaiting further confirmation of the emerging trends before making a decisive move.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-17</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle Properties**<br /><br />| **Property**          | **Value** |<br />|-----------------------|-----------|<br />| Open                  | 663.07    |<br />| High                  | 666.32    |<br />| Low                   | 658.06    |<br />| Close                 | 658.91    |<br />| Adj Close             | 658.91    |<br />| Volume                | 1156300   |<br /><br />**Moving Averages**<br /><br />| **Moving Average**     | **Value** |<br />|-----------------------|-----------|<br />| SMA_50                | 625.71    |<br />| SMA_200               | 605.55    |<br />| EMA_50                | 625.12    |<br />| EMA_200               | 604.82    |<br /><br />**Technical Indicators**<br /><br />| **Indicator**          | **Value** |<br />|-----------------------|-----------|<br />| RSI_14                | 14.73     |<br />| MACD_12_26_12        | -1.12     |<br />| Signal line           | 0.39      |<br />| Histogram             | -1.51     |<br />| Bollinger Bands       | -          |<br />| Upper Band (BBU)      | 675.63    |<br />| Middle Band (BBM)     | 658.91    |<br />| Lower Band (BBB)      | 642.19    |<br />| Bandwidth (BBP)       | 13.44     |<br />| Stochastic Oscillator | -          |<br />| %K line               | 10.96     |<br />| %D line               | 10.85     |<br />| ATRr_14               | 15.23     |<br /><br />**Observations**<br /><br />The last closing candle indicates oversold conditions, as evidenced by the RSI being below 30 and the price closing near the lower Bollinger Band.

The %K line (3-day moving average) crossed below the %D line (3-day signal line), which is a **bearish signal**.<br /><br />**Conclusion:** The last closing candle is slightly bullish, with the price closing higher than it opened and near the upper Bollinger Band. However, some of the technical indicators, such as the MACD and stochastic oscillator, are showing bearish signals. Therefore, it may be a good time to be **cautiously bullish**, with a focus on risk management. It may also be a good idea to wait for confirmation of the bullish trend before making any major investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-10</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle**<br />---------------------<br /><br />The last closing candle in the provided 90-day price data is for the date **2024-07-10**. The open price for this candle was **62.72**, the high was **62.86**, the low was **62.28**, and the close was **62.83**.<br /><br />**Candle Analysis**<br />------------------<br /><br />This means that the candle was a **bullish candle**, with the price closing higher than it opened. However, the fact that the close is only slightly higher than the open, and the body of the candle is relatively small, may indicate some hesitation or weakness in the bullish movement.<br /><br />**Volume**<br />---------<br /><br />The volume for this candle was **11784879**, which is slightly above the average volume for the past 90 days. This indicates that there was some decent interest in the stock on this day, but it was not an extraordinarily high volume day.<br /><br />**Moving Averages**<br />------------------<br /><br />The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) for the stock is **62.94**, while the 200-day SMA is **59.0**. This means that the stock is currently trading above both its short-term and long-term moving averages, which is a bullish sign. However, the fact that the 50-day SMA is very close to the price of the last closing candle may indicate that the stock is due for a correction in the near future.<br /><br />The exponential moving averages (EMAs) for the past 50 and 200 days are also bullish, with the 50-day EMA at **62.91** and the 200-day EMA at **59.5**. This means that the short-term trend for the stock is up, and it has been for some time.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI)**<br />-------------------------------<br /><br />The RSI for the past 14 days is **47.0**, which is in neutral territory. This means that the stock is not overbought or oversold, and there is no immediate indication of a trend change.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**<br />---------------------------------------------<br /><br />The MACD for the past 12, 26, and 9 days is also in neutral territory, with the signal line and the histogram both hovering around zero. This indicates that there is no clear trend in the stock's momentum at the moment.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands**<br />------------------<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands for the past 20 days are relatively tight, with the upper band at **64.24**, the middle band at **62.83**, and the lower band at **61.42**. This indicates that the stock is currently trading within a narrow range, and any breakout above or below the bands could signal a trend change.<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator**<br />-----------------------<br /><br />The stochastic oscillator for the past 14 days is also in neutral territory, with the %K line at **50.3** and the %D line at **50.0**. This means that the stock is not overbought or oversold, and there is no immediate indication of a trend change.<br /><br />**Conclusion**<br />------------<br /><br />Based on this analysis, the last closing candle does not provide a clear indication of whether the stock is a good buy or not. The stock is currently trading above its short-term and long-term moving averages, which is a bullish sign. However, the small size of the candle's body and the fact that the 50-day SMA is very close to the price may indicate that the stock is due for a correction in the near future. The RSI, MACD, and stochastic oscillator are all in neutral territory, which further complicates the picture. Therefore, it may be wise to wait for a clearer signal before making a decision to buy or sell this stock. Investors could consider waiting for a breakout above or below the Bollinger Bands, or for a clear trend to emerge in the RSI, MACD, or stochastic oscillator. Alternatively, investors could consider looking at other technical or fundamental indicators to help make their decision.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr class='parent-row inconclusive inconclusive_daily' id='LIN'><td>LIN</td><td>Linde plc Ordinary Shares</td><td>2024-07-19</td><td>neutral</td></tr><tr class='explanation-table LIN'><td colspan='4'>**Weekly Stock Market Analysis**---------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Data:** 2024-07-15<br /><br />* Close: 444.75<br />* Open: 440.7<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* SMA 50: 417.53<br />* SMA 200: 334.3<br />* EMA 50: 418.15<br />* EMA 200: 339.74<br /><br />**Moving Average Crossover:** Short-term moving averages are above long-term moving averages.<br /><br />**RSI (Relative Strength Index):**<br /><br />* RSI 14: 57.83<br /><br />**RSI Range:** Neutral (between 30 and 70).<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />* MACD 12 26 12: -2.8<br />* MACDh 12 26 12: 8.12<br />* MACDs 12 26 12: -5.82<br /><br />**MACD Signal:** Bearish trend in the short term.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />* BBL 20 2.0: 411.13<br />* BBM 20 2.0: 444.75<br />* BBU 20 2.0: 473.98<br />* BBB 20 2.0: 398.85<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands Position:** Stock is trading near the upper Bollinger Band.<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:**<br /><br />* STOCHk 14 3 3: 81.2<br />* STOCHd 14 3 3: 74.84<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator Signal:** Stock may be overbought in the short term.<br /><br />**Average True Range (ATR):**<br /><br />* ATRr 14: 13.66<br /><br />**ATR Signal:** High level of volatility in recent weeks.</td></tr><tr class='child-table LIN'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent LIN'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-19</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**__________________________________________<br /><br />**Period of Analysis:** April 22, 2024, to July 19, 2024<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle:** July 19, 2024<br /><br />**Price Data:**<br />- Open: 445.37<br />- High: 445.6<br />- Low: 441.92<br />- Close: 444.75<br />- Adjusted Close: 444.75<br />- Volume: 1,395,137<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />**1.

A neutral stance may be appropriate until further price action can provide a clearer signal.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr class='parent-row sell sell_daily' id='LLY'><td>LLY</td><td>Eli Lilly and Company Common Stock</td><td>2024-07-19</td><td>bearish</td></tr><tr class='explanation-table LLY'><td colspan='4'>**Weekly Stock Market Analysis**---------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle:** 2024-07-15<br /><br />* Close: **857.47**<br />* Open: **956.2**<br />* High: **966.1**<br />* Low: **836.66**<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* SMA 50: **689.65**<br />* SMA 200: **383.52**<br />* EMA 50: **696.46**<br />* EMA 200: **441.81**<br />* RSI 14: **61.11**<br />* MACD 12 26 12: **64.03**<br />* MACDh 12 26 12: **68.82**<br />* MACDs 12 26 12: **-4.75**<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />* BBL 20 2.0: **683.51**<br />* BBM 20 2.0: **816.12**<br />* BBU 20 2.0: **948.74**<br />* BBB 20 2.0: **811.77**<br />* BBP 20 2.0: **-32.5**<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:**<br /><br />* STOCHk 14 3 3: **58.41**<br />* STOCHd 14 3 3: **91.82**<br /><br />**Average True Range:**<br /><br />* ATRr 14: **46.35**<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />The last closing candle on the weekly chart shows a bearish signal, as the close price is lower than the open price.

The open price for this candle was 66.11, the high was 67.47, the low was 66.11, and the close was 67.12.<br /><br />**Volume**<br /><br />The volume for this candle was 74,042,000 shares. This indicates the number of shares traded during the day and can be an indicator of the strength of a move. In this case, the volume is slightly above average, suggesting that the move from the open to the close was supported by strong buying interest.<br /><br />**Moving Averages**<br /><br />The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is 67.9, and the 200-day SMA is 69.76. The 50-day SMA is used to determine the short-term trend, while the 200-day SMA is used for the long-term trend. Both the short-term and long-term trends are slightly downward sloping, which could suggest a bearish outlook. However, the price is currently trading above both SMAs, which could be a bullish sign.<br /><br />**Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs)**<br /><br />The exponential moving averages (EMAs) for 50 and 200 days are 67.84 and 69.52, respectively. EMAs give more weight to recent prices, making them more responsive to new information. The 50-day EMA is below the 200-day EMA, which is a bearish signal known as the "death cross." However, the price is currently trading above both EMAs, which could be a bullish sign.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI)**<br /><br />The relative strength index (RSI) for 14 periods is 53.28. The RSI is a momentum oscillator that can help identify overbought or oversold conditions. A reading above 70 suggests that a security is overbought, while a reading below 30 suggests that it is oversold. In this case, a reading of 53.28 is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting that the stock is in neutral territory.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**<br /><br />The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) for 12, 26, and 9 periods is -0.64, -0.13, and -0.51, respectively. The MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages. A positive MACD indicates that the short-term average is above the long-term average, which is a bullish signal. A negative MACD indicates that the short-term average is below the long-term average, which is a bearish signal. In this case, the MACD is negative, suggesting a bearish outlook.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands**<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands for 20 periods with a 2.0 standard deviation are 64.33, 68.18, and 72.03. Bollinger Bands are volatility bands placed above and below a moving average. The bands widen when volatility increases and narrow when volatility decreases. The price is currently trading near the upper Bollinger Band, which could suggest that the stock is overbought.<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator**<br /><br />The stochastic oscillator for 14 periods, 3, 3 is 64.37. The stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator that compares a security's closing price to its price range over a given time period. A reading above 80 suggests that a security is overbought, while a reading below 20 suggests that it is oversold. In this case, a reading of 64.37 is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting that the stock is in neutral territory.<br /><br />**Average True Range (ATR)**<br /><br />The average true range (ATR) for 14 periods is 1.01. The ATR is a volatility indicator that measures the volatility of a security over a given time period. A higher ATR value suggests that a security is more volatile, while a lower ATR value suggests that it is less volatile. In this case, the ATR value is relatively low, suggesting that the stock is not very volatile.<br /><br />**Conclusion**<br /><br />In conclusion, the last closing candle indicates a slightly bearish outlook due to the downward sloping short-term and long-term trends, the negative MACD, and the price trading near the upper Bollinger Band. However, the bullish signals such as the price trading above both SMAs and EMAs, and the RSI and stochastic oscillator being in neutral territory suggest that the stock could still move higher. Therefore, it is recommended to be neutral at this point and closely monitor the stock for further developments.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-16</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Close:** 65.83<br />**Open:** 64.22<br />**High:** 65.88<br />**Low:** 64.18<br /><br />**1.61**<br /><br />**Bullish Engulfing Candle:** The last closing candle is a bullish engulfing candle, which indicates a potential reversal in the market trend.

The open price of the candle was 129.4, the high was 129.93, and the low was 127.32. The candle's range is relatively narrow, suggesting a period of consolidation before the bearish move.<br /><br />The SMA_50 (Simple Moving Average for the past 50 days) is 129.01, and the SMA_200 (Simple Moving Average for the past 200 days) is 118.67.

However, the Bollinger Band Percentage (BBP) is at 0.66, which is relatively low, suggesting that the price may be due for a correction.<br /><br />The Stochastic Oscillator is at 65.66 for the %K line and 68.91 for the %D line, which is a neutral to slightly bullish signal. However, the Stochastic Oscillator has turned down from overbought levels, indicating a potential slowdown in the uptrend.<br /><br />In summary, the last closing candle does not provide a clear signal to be bullish, bearish, or neutral. While there are some bullish signals, such as the SMA and EMA crossovers, there are also some bearish signals, such as the slightly bearish candle and the narrowing MACD histogram. Additionally, some indicators, such as the RSI and Stochastic Oscillator, are at neutral levels, suggesting a potential slowdown in the uptrend. Therefore, it may be prudent to adopt a neutral to slightly cautious stance until there is a clearer signal.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr class='parent-row sell inconclusive_daily' id='MSFT'><td>MSFT</td><td>Microsoft Corporation Common Stock</td><td>2024-07-19</td><td>bearish</td></tr><tr class='explanation-table MSFT'><td colspan='4'>**Weekly Stock Market Analysis Report**__<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-15<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle:**<br /><br />Open: 453.3<br />High: 457.26<br />Low: 432.0<br />Close: **437.11**<br />Adj Close: 437.11<br /><br />**Technical Analysis:**<br /><br />The closing price of the last candle is lower than the opening price, indicating a bearish signal.

This trend is further supported by the fact that the close price is also lower than the previous week's close price (92.88).<br /><br />The moving averages, SMA 50 (100.74) and SMA 200 (95.76), are both above the close price, which is a bearish signal. The same is true for the EMA 50 (97.48) and EMA 200 (90.33).<br /><br />The RSI 14 is 44.71, which is close to the neutral zone (50), but still slightly bearish.<br /><br />The MACD indicators suggest a strong bearish trend.

The BBP 20 2.0 is 0.32, which is close to the lower Bollinger Band, indicating a bearish trend.<br /><br />The STOCH indicators suggest a bearish trend as well.

The close price is lower than the open price and the previous week's close price, and the moving averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and STOCH indicators all suggest a downward trend. However, the ATRr 14 is relatively low, indicating low volatility. Therefore, it may be a good time to consider bearish strategies, but it's important to monitor the market closely for any changes in trend.</td></tr><tr class='child-table NTES'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent NTES'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-19</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**__________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-20<br /><br />**Stock Closing Price:** 91.35<br /><br />**Change from Previous Day:** -0.53 points<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 91.26<br /><br />**High:** 91.88<br /><br />**Low:** 90.61<br /><br />**Trading Volume:** 1,194,726<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />| **Moving Average** | **Value** |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| 50-day SMA | 94.2 |<br />| 200-day SMA | 100.62 |<br />| 50-day EMA | 94.31 |<br />| 200-day EMA | 100.67 |<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| **Technical Indicator** | **Value** |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| RSI (14-day) | 44.89 |<br />| MACD Histogram (12, 26, 9 days) | -0.42 |<br />| Bollinger Bands (20 days) | Near lower band |<br />| Stochastic Oscillator (14 days) | 0.05 |<br />| 3-day moving average of Stochastic Oscillator | 0.04 |<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />The stock closed at 91.35 on 2024-07-19, marking a decrease of 0.53 points from the previous day's closing price.

However, the fact that the closing price is below the SMAs suggests that the long-term trend is downward.<br /><br />The relative strength index (RSI_14) is 65.22, which is above the neutral level of 50, indicating that the stock is overbought.

However, the stochastic oscillator (STOCHd_14_3_3) is 69.4, which is above the neutral level of 50, indicating that the stock is overbought. This is a bearish signal, as it suggests that the stock is due for a correction.<br /><br />The average true range (ATRr_14) is 9.91, which is relatively high, indicating that the stock is volatile.<br /><br />In summary, based on the technical indicators, the last closing candle suggests that the stock is overbought and due for a correction. The long-term trend is downward, as evidenced by the closing price being below both the SMA_50 and SMA_200. The bearish signals from the MACD and stochastic oscillator also suggest that the stock is likely to decline in the near term.</td></tr><tr class='child-table NVDA'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent NVDA'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-19</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-19<br /><br />**Stock Closing Price:** 117.93<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 120.35<br /><br />**High:** 121.6<br /><br />**Low:** 117.37<br /><br />**Previous Close:** 121.09<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Technical Indicators**<br /><br />**50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA):** 116.15<br /><br />**200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA):** 77.15<br /><br />**50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA):** 116.15<br /><br />**200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA):** 77.08<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 44.29<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**<br /><br />**MACD Line:** -3.15<br /><br />**Signal Line:** -0.95<br /><br />**MACD Histogram:** -2.2<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands**<br /><br />**Bollinger Band Lower Line (BBL):** 113.15<br /><br />**Bollinger Band Middle Line (BBM):** 125.58<br /><br />**Bollinger Band Upper Line (BBU):** 131.79<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator**<br /><br />**STOCH%K:** 3.92<br /><br />**STOCH%D:** 1.14<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Analysis:**<br /><br />The stock's last closing price was 117.93, representing a significant drop from the previous close of 121.09.

The Bollinger Bands are relatively tight, with the close near the lower band, which is a bearish signal. However, the stochastic oscillator is in the oversold zone, with %K at 22.4 and %D at 25.2, which is a bullish signal. The high volatility indicated by the ATR of 3.43 suggests that the stock may be risky in the short term. Overall, the last closing candle does not provide a clear signal for investors and traders. The bearish signals from the moving averages and Bollinger Bands are somewhat offset by the bullish signal from the stochastic oscillator.

This price is slightly higher than the opening price of 110.03, indicating a small increase in the stock price during the day. The high of the day was 110.62, and the low was 110.01, which shows that the stock price remained relatively stable throughout the day.<br /><br />The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is 104.53, and the 200-day SMA is 100.3. The 50-day SMA is above the 200-day SMA, which is a bullish signal. The exponential moving averages (EMA) for 50 and 200 days are 104.37 and 100.25, respectively, with the 50-day EMA also above the 200-day EMA.<br /><br />The relative strength index (RSI) for the last closing candle is 1.8, which is a neutral value. This suggests that the stock is not overbought or oversold at the moment.<br /><br />The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) for the last closing candle is calculated as follows:<br /><br />* MACD line: 12-day EMA (110.53) - 26-day EMA (110.36) = 0.17<br />* Signal line: 9-day EMA of MACD line (0.17) = 0.17<br />* Histogram: MACD line (0.17) - Signal line (0.17) = 0<br /><br />The MACD line is above the signal line, which is a bullish signal. However, the histogram is flat, indicating that the MACD line and the signal line are currently moving in parallel.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands for the last closing candle are calculated as follows:<br /><br />* Upper band: 20-day moving average (110.33) + 2 \* standard deviation (1.55) = 113.43<br />* Middle band: 20-day moving average (110.33) = 110.33<br />* Lower band: 20-day moving average (110.33) - 2 \* standard deviation (1.55) = 107.23<br /><br />The closing price of 110.53 is above the middle band but below the upper band, indicating that the stock price is within the normal range.<br /><br />The stochastic oscillator for the last closing candle is calculated as follows:<br /><br />* %K line: (110.53 - 107.23) / (113.43 - 107.23) \* 100 = 62.5<br />* %D line: 3-day simple moving average of %K line (62.5) = 62.5<br /><br />The %K line is above the %D line, which is a bullish signal. However, both lines are in the middle of the range, indicating that the stock is not overbought or oversold.<br /><br />The average true range (ATR) for the last closing candle is 1.26, which is a measure of volatility. This value indicates that the stock has low volatility.<br /><br />Based on the analysis of the last closing candle, the stock price has increased slightly during the day, and the moving averages and the MACD line are bullish signals. However, the RSI and the stochastic oscillator are neutral, and the stock is within the normal range of the Bollinger Bands.

The open price for this candle is 170.3, the high is 170.49, the low is 168.48, and the close is 169.36. The close is below the open, indicating a bearish trend.<br /><br />The 50-day SMA is 170.48, and the 200-day SMA is 168.66. The 50-day SMA is above the 200-day SMA, which is a bullish signal. However, the close of the last candle is below both SMAs, which is a bearish signal.<br /><br />The EMAs for 50 and 200 days are 170.88 and 168.42, respectively. The EMAs also indicate a bearish trend, as the close is below both EMAs.<br /><br />The RSI for the last candle is 2.96, which is a neutral value. The RSI ranges from 0 to 100, with values below 30 indicating oversold conditions and values above 70 indicating overbought conditions. A neutral RSI value does not provide a clear indication of the trend direction.<br /><br />The MACD for the last candle is -1.5, which is a bearish signal. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-day EMA from the 12-day EMA. A negative MACD value indicates a bearish trend.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands for the last candle are 170.76 (upper band), 168.6 (middle band), and 166.44 (lower band). The close of the last candle is below the middle band, which is a bearish signal.<br /><br />The Stochastic Oscillator for the last candle is -1.5, which is a bearish signal. The Stochastic Oscillator ranges from 0 to 100, with values below 20 indicating oversold conditions and values above 80 indicating overbought conditions. A negative Stochastic Oscillator value indicates a bearish trend.<br /><br />Based on the above analysis, the last closing candle does not indicate a good time to be bullish. The bearish signals from the close price, SMAs, EMAs, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and Stochastic Oscillator suggest a downward trend. However, the RSI value is neutral, indicating that the trend may not be strong. Therefore, it is advisable to be cautious and monitor the market trend closely.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-18</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Closing Price:** The closing price for the stock on 2024-07-18 was **170.37**.<br /><br />**Open Price:** The open price for the stock on 2024-07-18 was **168.71**.<br /><br />**High and Low:** The high price for the stock on 2024-07-18 was **172.67**, and the low price was **168.39**.<br /><br />**Trading Volume:** The trading volume for the stock on 2024-07-18 was **6,227,100**.<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* **50-day SMA:** The 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) was **170.65**.<br />* **200-day SMA:** The 200-day SMA was **170.89**.<br />* **50-day EMA:** The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) was **170.59**.<br />* **200-day EMA:** The 200-day EMA was **171.35**.<br />* **RSI:** The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was **39.84**.<br />* **MACD:** The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line crossed below the signal line, indicating a downward trend.<br />* **Bollinger Bands:** The closing price was near the lower band, suggesting that the stock is currently undervalued.<br />* **Stochastic Oscillator:** The Stochastic Oscillator was at **17.42**, which is below the oversold threshold of 20, indicating that the stock is significantly oversold.<br /><br />**Trend Analysis:** Based on the provided technical indicators, the stock is currently trading below its short-term and long-term averages, and both the RSI and Stochastic Oscillator indicate an oversold condition.

However, the 50-day SMA has recently crossed above the 200-day SMA, which is often seen as a bullish signal. The RSI and stochastic oscillator are also close to neutral levels, indicating that the stock is not overbought or oversold at the moment. Overall, the data suggests that it may be a good time to be bearish on the stock, but it is important to continue monitoring the price and indicators for further developments.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-17</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Analysis of the Last Closing Candle (2024-07-17):**<br /><br />The last closing candle's key statistics are as follows:<br /><br />- Open price: 61.11<br />- High price: 61.84<br />- Low price: 60.65<br />- Close price: 61.24<br /><br />**Price Action:**<br /><br />The last closing candle formed a small real body with a slight upward trend, indicating a potential bullish sentiment. However, the upper wick is relatively long, suggesting that the bullish momentum may be weakening.<br /><br />**Volume:**<br /><br />The volume on this day was 8,314,000, which is slightly below the average volume for the past 90 days (12,473,600). A lower volume on the last candle might indicate a lack of conviction in the current price trend.<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />- 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA): 61.98<br />- 200-day SMA: 62.14<br /><br />The 50-day SMA is below the 200-day SMA, which is a bearish signal. However, the close price is above both SMAs, which could be interpreted as a bullish sign.<br /><br />**Exponential Moving Averages (EMA):**<br /><br />- 50-day EMA: 62.07<br />- 200-day EMA: 63.74<br /><br />The EMAs show a similar pattern to the SMAs, with the 50-day EMA below the 200-day EMA. The close price is above the 50-day EMA but below the 200-day EMA.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):**<br /><br />The RSI for the past 14 periods is 53.65, which is a neutral signal, as it is neither overbought nor oversold.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />The MACD shows a bearish signal, with the MACD line (12-day EMA - 26-day EMA) below the signal line (9-day EMA of MACD line).<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />The last closing price is near the lower band, suggesting that the price may be oversold in the short term.<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator (SO):**<br /><br />The SO shows a neutral signal, with the %K line (14-period SO) at 50.16 and the %D line (3-period moving average of %K) at 50.0.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle has mixed signals. The small real body and close price above SMAs and EMAs suggest a bullish sentiment, but the long upper wick, lower volume, and bearish MACD indicate potential weakness in the uptrend. The RSI, SO, and Bollinger Bands are neutral. Therefore, it might be a cautious time to be bullish, and traders should monitor the stock closely for further confirmation of the trend.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-16</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-16<br /><br />**Closing Price:** 61.81, an increase of 1.01 points or 1.67% compared to the previous close.<br /><br />**Open Price:** 60.8<br /><br />**High:** 62.02<br /><br />**Low:** 60.68<br /><br />**Trading Volume:** 9,184,000<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Moving Averages**<br /><br />* 50-day SMA: 62.07<br />* 200-day SMA: 61.5<br /><br />**Current Price Position:** The stock is currently trading above both its short-term and long-term moving averages, which can be seen as a bullish signal.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)**<br /><br />* EMA-50: 61.9<br />* EMA-200: 63.75<br /><br />**Current Price Position:** The stock price is currently above both EMAs, which is a bullish sign.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI)**<br /><br />* RSI: 57.14<br /><br />**Interpretation:** The RSI for the last closing candle is 57.14, which is in the neutral zone (between 30 and 70).

However, the RSI is at 58.05, which is close to the neutral level of 50, and the MACD histogram is positive but relatively small, indicating that the short-term momentum may be waning.<br /><br />Additionally, the Bollinger Bands are relatively wide, suggesting that the stock price may be volatile in the near term. The price is near the upper Bollinger Band, which could be a bearish sign, but the BBP is also near the upper Bollinger Band, indicating that the price may be overbought but not necessarily overvalued.<br /><br />The Stochastic Oscillator is also indicating that the stock may be overbought, with both the %K and %D lines above 80. However, this could also be a sign of a strong uptrend, so it is important to consider other indicators as well.<br /><br />Overall, the last closing candle does not provide a clear signal for investors. While there are some positive signs, such as the price being above the moving averages, there are also some potential warning signs, such as the overbought indicators. Therefore, it may be best to take a neutral stance and wait for further confirmation of the trend before making any investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-10</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle**<br />---------------------<br /><br />The last closing candle in the provided 90 days of price data is for the date **2024-07-10**.

However, some short-term indicators suggest that the stock may be overbought and due for a pullback.
