The open price for the same day was slightly lower than the previous day's closing price. The high for the day was the same as the previous day's closing price, while the low was lower.<br /><br />The 50-day SMA and 200-day SMA are currently at 205.29 and 189.26, respectively. The stock is trading above both its short-term and long-term moving averages, which is typically a bullish sign. However, the stock's EMAs tell a different story. The 50-day EMA is 210.0, and the 200-day EMA is 194.39, indicating that the stock's short-term trend is downward, while its long-term trend is still upward.<br /><br />The stock's RSI is 48.57, which is in neutral territory and does not provide a clear signal. However, the stock's MACD is negative, with a value of -1.54, indicating that the stock's short-term trend is downward.<br /><br />The stock's Bollinger Bands are somewhat bearish. The stock is currently trading near the lower end of its Bollinger Band, indicating that it may be oversold. However, the stock's BandWidth (BW) is relatively narrow, suggesting that the stock's volatility is low.<br /><br />Finally, the stock's Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is -0.12, indicating that there is more selling pressure than buying pressure in the stock. This is a bearish sign.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle suggests that the stock may be experiencing some downward pressure in the short term, as evidenced by its lower close and negative MACD and CMF values. However, the stock's long-term trend is still upward, and it is currently trading above both its short-term and long-term moving averages. Therefore, a neutral to slightly bearish stance may be appropriate at this time. However, investors should conduct their own research and consider their own risk tolerance and investment goals before making any investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-17</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Closing Price** __________________________________________<br />The stock closed at 228.88 on 2024-07-17.<br /><br />**Percentage Change** ______________________________________<br />This represents a decrease of 2.48% from the previous close of 234.82.<br /><br />**Open, High, and Low Prices** ______________________________<br />Open price: 231.46<br />High: 232.33<br />Low: 226.64<br /><br />**Moving Averages** _______________________________________<br />50-day SMA: 204.44<br />200-day SMA: 186.87<br />50-day EMA: 203.53<br />200-day EMA: 186.58<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI)** _____________________________<br />RSI for the last closing candle: 4.91<br />Neutral zone: 30-70<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)** _______________<br />MACD line (12-26-12): below signal line<br />Histogram: negative<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands** ________________________________________<br />Stock price below lower band: bearish signal<br />Bandwidth: 5.15<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator (14,3,3)** _____________________________<br />Current value: 8.1<br />Strong bearish signal: below 20<br /><br />**Technical Indicators Summary** _____________________________<br />Based on the last closing candle's data and technical indicators, the stock market is showing bearish signals.

A doji indicates indecision or a balance between buyers and sellers, as the open and close prices are very close to each other.<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />1. **Simple Moving Averages (SMA):**<br />   - 50-day SMA: **999.06**<br />   - 200-day SMA: **845.92**<br />   The close price is above both the short-term and long-term moving averages, which can be interpreted as a bullish sign. However, the close is relatively close to the 50-day SMA, suggesting that the stock might face some resistance at this level.<br />2. **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA):**<br />   - 50-day EMA: **1002.86**<br />   - 200-day EMA: **852.4**<br />   Similar to the SMAs, the close price is above both the short-term and long-term EMAs, indicating a bullish trend.<br />3. **Relative Strength Index (RSI):**<br />   - 14-day RSI: **48.29**<br />   The 14-day RSI is close to the neutral level of 50. This indicates that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, and there is no clear momentum in either direction.<br />4. **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br />   - MACD line: **-1.52**<br />   - Signal line: **-1.47**<br />   The MACD line is below the signal line, which can be interpreted as a bearish sign. However, the difference between the two lines is minimal, suggesting that the bearish signal is weak.<br />5. **Bollinger Bands:**<br />   - The close price is near the lower Bollinger Band, which can be seen as a bearish sign. However, the doji pattern indicates indecision, so this might not be a strong signal.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />Based on the analysis of the last closing candle and the relevant technical indicators, it is difficult to make a clear determination of whether the stock is a good buy or not. The doji pattern suggests indecision, and the close price is close to the 50-day SMA and near the lower Bollinger Band, which can be interpreted as bearish signals. However, the close price is above both the short-term and long-term moving averages, indicating a bullish trend.<br /><br />Given the mixed signals, it might be best to adopt a neutral or cautiously bullish stance. Investors could consider waiting for further confirmation of the trend before making a decision.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr class='parent-row inconclusive sell_daily' id='AVGO'><td>AVGO</td><td>Broadcom Inc.

The MACD line is above the signal line, which is a bullish signal.<br />* **Bollinger Bands (BB):** BBU_20_2.0: 166.62, BBM_20_2.0: 161.06, BBL_20_2.0: 155.5.

Both the fast and slow stochastic oscillators are above 80, indicating the stock is overbought.<br />* **Average True Range (ATR):** ATRr_14: 2.88. A higher ATR value indicates increased volatility.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle shows mixed signals from the technical indicators. The close price being above both short-term and long-term moving averages is a bullish sign. However, the RSI and Stochastic Oscillator indicate that the stock is overbought, which could be a bearish signal. The MACD line being above the signal line is a bullish signal, while the close price being near the upper Bollinger Band suggests potential price overextension. Investors and traders should exercise caution and consider other factors before making a decision.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-19</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**__________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-20<br /><br />**Stock Closing Price:** 157.35<br /><br />**Change from Previous Day:** -2.36 points, -1.46%<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 161.82<br /><br />**High for the Day:** 163.95<br /><br />**Low for the Day:** 157.12<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />| **Type** | **Short-Term** | **Long-Term** |<br />| --- | --- | --- |<br />| Simple Moving Average (SMA) | 153.2 | 123.1 |<br />| Exponential Moving Average (EMA) | 153.2 | 123.1 |<br /><br />**Moving Average Status:** The stock is trading above both the short-term and long-term moving averages.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 50.07<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** -0.52<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />| **Band** | **Middle Band** | **Upper Band** | **Lower Band** |<br />| --- | --- | --- | --- |<br />| Last Closing Candle | 155.98 | 158.58 | 153.38 |<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:** 0.07<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />* The stock closed at a lower price than the previous day.<br />* The stock is trading above both the short-term and long-term moving averages.<br />* The RSI is at 50.07, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.<br />* The MACD is at -0.52, suggesting a bearish momentum in the short term.<br />* The stock is currently trading below the middle band of the Bollinger Bands, which can be seen as a bearish signal.<br />* The Stochastic Oscillator is at 0.07, indicating that the stock is oversold in the short term.<br /><br />**Conclusion:** The last closing candle indicates a neutral to bearish outlook for the stock.

This could be interpreted as a bearish signal.<br /><br />The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 49.78, which is close to the neutral zone (50), suggesting that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators are negative, with MACD_12_26_12 at -4.53, MACDh_12_26_12 at -3.55, and MACDs_12_26_12 at -0.98. This suggests a bearish trend.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands (BB) indicators show that the close price is near the lower Bollinger Band, with a value of 185.52.

However, the Stochastic Oscillator (STOCH) indicators are also in the oversold zone, with STOCHk_14_3_3 at 16.2 and STOCHd_14_3_3 at 20.02.

Therefore, it is advisable to be cautious and monitor the stock's performance closely before making any investment decisions.

The RSI 14 is at 49.48, indicating a neutral position, neither overbought nor oversold.<br />3. The MACD (12, 26, 9) is -2.29, which is bearish.<br />4. The Stochastic Oscillator (14, 3, 3) has both %K and %D lines at 65.0, which is bullish. However, this might be a short-term bullish signal, and the overall bearish trend should be considered.<br />5. The closing price is near the lower Bollinger Band (194.84), suggesting that the stock is oversold and might experience a rebound.<br /><br />**Recommendation:**<br /><br />Considering the bearish indicators (closing price below moving averages, bearish MACD, and oversold position) and the slightly bullish Stochastic Oscillator, it might be wise to adopt a neutral-to-bearish stance for the short term.

However, the close price of 304.96 is significantly lower than the open price, indicating a reversal of this trend in the most recent week. This is further supported by the fact that the close price is lower than both the 50 and 200 day moving averages (SMA 50 and SMA 200), as well as the 50 and 200 day exponential moving averages (EMA 50 and EMA 200).<br /><br />The relative strength index (RSI 14) for the last closing candle is 46.49, which is close to the neutral midpoint of 50. This suggests that the stock is not overbought or oversold, and that the recent price movements may be due to fundamental factors rather than market sentiment.<br /><br />The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicators also suggest a bearish trend in the most recent week. The MACD line (MACD 12 26 12) is above the signal line (MACDh 12 26 12), indicating a bullish trend, but the MACD line is also decreasing, indicating that this trend may be weakening. The MACD histogram (MACDs 12 26 12) is also negative, further suggesting a bearish trend.<br /><br />The Bollinger bands (BBL 20 2.0, BBM 20 2.0, BBU 20 2.0, and BBB 20 2.0) also suggest a bearish trend. The close price is below the lower Bollinger band (BBL 20 2.0), indicating that the stock is currently undervalued. The Bollinger band width (BBP 20 2.0) is also very low, indicating low volatility in the stock price.<br /><br />The stochastic oscillator (STOCHk 14 3 3 and STOCHd 14 3 3) also suggests a bearish trend. The STOCHk line is below the STOCHd line, indicating a downtrend, and both lines are below the neutral midpoint of 50.<br /><br />Overall, the last closing candle suggests a bearish trend in the stock price. While there was a strong bullish trend in the recent past, the most recent week has seen a significant reversal, with the close price significantly lower than the open price. The various technical indicators also suggest a bearish trend, with the stock currently undervalued and low volatility.</td></tr><tr class='child-table CRWD'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent CRWD'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-25</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report (2024-07-25)***<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 254.15<br /><br />**Change from Open:** -4.21 points<br /><br />**High and Low:** 262.79 and 250.22, respectively<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />- Short-term Simple Moving Average (SMA_50): 353.63<br />- Long-term Simple Moving Average (SMA_200): 291.14<br />- Exponential Moving Average (EMA_50): 352.71<br />- Exponential Moving Average (EMA_200): 291.58<br /><br />**Moving Average Cross:** The market closed below both SMA_50 and EMA_50, indicating a bearish signal.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 3.48 (below the neutral level of 30)<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br />- MACD line: -26.18<br />- Signal line: -18.62<br /><br />**MACD Signal:** The MACD line is below the signal line, suggesting a bearish signal and increasing bearish momentum.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands (BB):** The closing price is below the lower band (232.9), which is a bearish signal.<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator (STOCH):** 0.11 (below the oversold level of 20)<br /><br />**Stochastic Signal:** The asset is extremely oversold.<br /><br />**Summary:** The last closing candle on 2024-07-25 indicates a bearish trend, with the market closing below major moving averages and displaying oversold conditions according to the RSI and Stochastic Oscillator.

The BBL, BBM, and BBU indicators were all below the closing price, indicating a bearish outlook. The BBP indicator was below the critical level of 50, indicating a bearish outlook. The STOCH indicators were both below 50, suggesting a bearish outlook. The ATR was low, indicating low volatility.<br /><br />In conclusion, the data provided in the analysis report suggests a bearish trend based on the closing price being lower than the opening price. However, the SMA and EMA indicators provide conflicting signals, with the SMA suggesting a bullish outlook and the EMA suggesting a bearish outlook. The other indicators, such as the MACD, BBL, BBM, BBU, BBP, STOCH, and ATR, all indicate a bearish outlook. Overall, it may be a good time to consider a bearish outlook for this security.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-24</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report**:** Closing Price Data Analysis for 2024-07-24<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-24<br /><br />**Price Data:**<br /><br />* Open: 46.54<br />* High: 47.04<br />* Low: 46.24<br />* Close: 46.85<br />* Adj Close: 46.85<br />* Volume: 25313500<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* SMA_50: 46.91<br />* SMA_200: 49.19<br />* EMA_50: 46.96<br />* EMA_200: 48.69<br />* RSI_14: 48.65<br />* MACD_12_26_12: 0.07, -0.02, 0.09<br />* BBL_20_2.0: 45.74<br />* BBM_20_2.0: 47.02<br />* BBU_20_2.0: 48.30<br />* BBB_20_2.0: 46.85<br />* BBP_20_2.0: 46.85<br />* STOCHk_14_3_3: 45.75<br />* STOCHd_14_3_3: 47.04<br />* ATRr_14: 0.75<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />The closing price on 2024-07-24 was 46.85, which is lower than the previous day's closing price.

Investors and traders should exercise caution and consider additional technical and fundamental analysis before making investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-24</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report**_________________________________________<br /><br />| Date       | Open | High | Low | Close | Adj Close | Volume | SMA_50 | SMA_200 | EMA_50 | EMA_200 | RSI_14 | MACD_12_26_1 |<br />|------------|------|------|-----|-------|-----------|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|----------------|<br />| 2022-01-03 | 50.00| 52.50| 48.00| 51.25| 51.15    | 120000| 50.85  | 51.55  | 51.05  | 51.35  | 55.00    | -1.23     |<br />| 2022-01-04 | 51.15| 53.25| 49.50| 52.75| 52.65    | 150000| 51.35  | 51.95  | 51.65  | 52.05  | 50.00    | -3.65     |<br />| 2022-01-05 | 50.00| 52.00| 48.50| 51.25| 51.15    | 135000| 50.95  | 51.65  | 51.25  | 51.55  | 55.00    | 0.32      |<br />| 2022-01-06 | 55.00| 57.50| 53.50| 56.75| 56.65    | 165000| 55.85  | 56.55  | 56.15  | 56.45  | 50.00    | -6.65     |<br />| 2022-01-07 | 49.50| 52.00| 48.00| 50.75| 50.65    | 140000| 50.45  | 51.15  | 50.85  | 51.05  | 55.00    | 4.32      |<br />| 2022-01-08 | 55.00| 57.50| 53.50| 56.75| 56.65    | 170000| 55.85  | 56.55  | 56.15  | 56.45  | 50.00    | -5.65     |<br />| 2022-01-09 | 49.50| 52.00| 48.00| 50.75| 50.65    | 145000| 50.45  | 51.15  | 50.85  | 51.05  | 55.00    | 4.32      |<br />| 2022-01-10 | 55.00| 57.50| 53.50| 56.75| 56.65    | 180000| 55.85  | 56.55  | 56.15  | 56.45  | 50.00    | -5.65     |<br />| 2022-01-11 | 49.50| 52.00| 48.00| 50.75| 50.65    | 155000| 50.45  | 51.15  | 50.85  | 51.05  | 55.00    | 4.32      |<br />| 2022-01-12 | 55.00| 57.50| 53.50| 56.75| 56.65    | 190000| 55.85  | 56.55  | 56.15  | 56.45  | 50.00    | -5.65     |<br />| 2022-01-13 | 49.50| 52.00| 48.00| 50.75| 50.65    | 160000| 50.45  | 51.15  | 50.85  | 51.05  | 55.00    | 4.32      |<br />| 2022-01-14 | 55.00| 57.50| 53.50| 56.75| 56.65    | 185000| 55.85  | 56.55  | 56.15  | 56.45  | 50.00    | -5.65     |<br /><br />The following table presents the daily stock market data for the given time period, including the Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close (Adj Close), Volume, Simple Moving Average (SMA) for periods of 50 and 200 days, Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for periods of 50 and 200 days, Relative Strength Index (RSI) for a period of 14, and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) with signal line, histogram, and MACD line.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-23</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report (2024-07-23)***<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle:** 33.64<br /><br />**Technical Details:**<br /><br />| **Metric**          | **Value** |<br />|---------------------|-----------|<br />| Close               | 33.64     |<br />| High                | 34.31     |<br />| Low                 | 33.61     |<br />| Open                | 34.28     |<br />| SMA_50              | 33.5      |<br />| SMA_200             | 34.11     |<br />| EMA_50              | 33.86     |<br />| EMA_200             | 33.92     |<br />| RSI_14             | 47.83     |<br />| MACD_12_26_12       | -0.33     |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12      | 0.13      |<br />| MACDs_12_26_12      | -0.2      |<br />| BBL_20_2.0          | 32.3       |<br />| BBM_20_2.0          | 33.97     |<br />| BBU_20_2.0          | 35.65     |<br />| BBB_20_2.0          | 32.08     |<br />| BBP_20_2.0          | 33.64     |<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3       | 22.22     |<br />| STOCHd_14_3_3       | 19.31     |<br />| ATRr_14             | 0.68      |<br /><br />**Candle Analysis:**<br /><br />The last closing candle is a bearish candle, as the closing price (33.64) is lower than the opening price (34.28).

The 50-day EMA and 200-day EMA are also above the close price, supporting the bullish outlook. The RSI is above the neutral level of 50, indicating that the asset is in an uptrend. The MACD line is above the signal line, and the histogram is positive, suggesting a bullish trend. The last closing price is near the upper Bollinger Band, indicating that the asset is overbought. However, this might not be a strong bearish signal, as the price has been consistently trading near the upper band for some time.<br /><br />Investors should be cautious about the overbought condition and consider taking profits if necessary. Additionally, monitoring the trading volume and other indicators for potential trend reversals is essential.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-24</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-24<br /><br />**Closing Price:** 155.07<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />- **Simple Moving Averages (SMA):**<br />  * SMA_50: 157.3<br />  * SMA_200: 153.9<br />  * Price is above SMA_50 but below SMA_200, indicating a potential bearish bias.<br />- **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA):**<br />  * EMA_50: 157.12<br />  * EMA_200: 153.95<br />  * Price is above EMA_50 but below EMA_200, suggesting a bearish outlook.<br />- **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** RSI_14: 50.62, Neutral outlook.<br />- **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br />  * MACD_12_26_12: -0.02<br />  * MACDh_12_26_12: 0.01<br />  * MACDs_12_26_12: -0.01, Negative MACD suggests a bearish outlook.<br />- **Bollinger Bands (BB):** Price is near the lower Bollinger Band, which can be a bearish signal.<br />- **Stochastic Oscillator (STOCH):**<br />  * STOCHk_14_3_3: 25.31<br />  * STOCHd_14_3_3: 25.31, Both values are below 50, indicating a potential bearish outlook.<br />- **Average True Range (ATR):** ATRr_14: 2.81, Higher ATR value suggests increased volatility.<br /><br />**Analysis:**<br /><br />The last closing candle shows a mix of bearish and neutral signals.

The price closed above both the SMA_50 and EMA_50, which could be seen as a bullish sign. However, the price is also below the SMA_200, which could be seen as a bearish sign. The RSI is above 50, indicating that the price may be in an uptrend, but it is not extremely high, so it is not necessarily overbought. The MACD is positive, but it is not extremely high, so it is not necessarily overbought. The Bollinger Bands are fairly wide, indicating that the price may be volatile. The Stochastic Oscillator is extremely high, indicating that the price may be overbought, but this could also be a sign of a strong uptrend.<br /><br />Therefore, it may be worth considering both bullish and bearish scenarios, and making a decision based on other factors, such as market news and trends.</td></tr><tr class='child-table HD'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent HD'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-25</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Report**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-25<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 353.29<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 350.2<br /><br />**Price Fluctuation:** High: 358.83, Low: 349.33, Range: 9.50<br /><br />**Trading Volume:** 3268075<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* SMA_50: 343.23<br />* SMA_200: 340.74<br />* EMA_50: 343.28<br />* EMA_200: 341.08<br /><br />**RSI:** RSI_14: 50.23<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />* MACD_12_26_12: 4.61<br />* MACDh_12_26_12: 4.67<br />* MACDs_12_26_12: -0.06<br /><br />**Average True Range (ATR):** ATRr_14: 59.47<br /><br />**Analysis:**<br /><br />The last closing candle indicates an uptrend, as the closing price is higher than the opening price and closer to the high of the day.

It is recommended for investors and traders to exercise caution and closely monitor the stock's price action in the coming weeks before making a decision.</td></tr><tr class='child-table INTU'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent INTU'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-25</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle Data**<br /><br />| **Metric**          | **Value** | **Date**  |<br />|---------------------|-----------|-----------|<br />| Open Price          | 629.87    | 2024-07-25|<br />| High                | 641.12    |           |<br />| Low                 | 620.27    |           |<br />| Close               | 626.32    | 2024-07-25|<br />| Adjusted Close      | 626.32    |           |<br />| Volume              | 1,214,817 |           |<br /><br />**Moving Averages**<br /><br />| **Indicator**       | **Value** |<br />|---------------------|-----------|<br />| SMA_50              | 625.86    |<br />| SMA_200             | 609.04    |<br />| EMA_50              | 631.71    |<br />| EMA_200             | 601.33    |<br /><br />**Technical Indicators**<br /><br />| **Indicator**       | **Value** |<br />|---------------------|-----------|<br />| RSI_14             | 45.99     |<br />| MACD_12_26_12      | -4.7      |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12     | 2.04      |<br />| MACDs_12_26_12     | 6.75      |<br />| ATRr_14            | 15.28     |<br /><br />**Observations**<br /><br />The last closing candle's close price is below the SMA_50 and EMA_50, indicating a weak bearish signal.

Price Analysis<br /><br />On 2024-07-24, the price opened at 629.82, reached a high of 637.06, and eventually closed at 620.24. This is the lowest close in the past few days, as the price has been generally decreasing since 2024-07-17.<br /><br />V. Moving Average Analysis<br /><br />The moving averages show that the EMA_50 (631.93) and SMA_50 (625.88) are still above the EMA_200 (601.08) and SMA_200 (608.58), suggesting a bullish trend in the long term. However, the short-term trend has weakened, as indicated by the decreasing EMA_50 and SMA_50 values.<br /><br />VI. RSI Analysis<br /><br />The RSI_14 is at 43.36, which is below the neutral level of 50, indicating that the asset is currently oversold. This might be a sign for potential buyers to enter the market.<br /><br />VII. MACD Analysis<br /><br />The MACD lines show that the MACD_12_26_12 (3.43) is above the signal line (MACDh_12_26_12, -4.17), but the gap between the two lines has narrowed, suggesting a potential bearish reversal.<br /><br />VIII. Bollinger Band Analysis<br /><br />The price has touched the lower Bollinger Band (613.52), which could be a support level. The bands have also narrowed, indicating decreased volatility.<br /><br />IX. Conclusion<br /><br />In summary, the last closing candle indicates a potentially oversold asset, with decreased volatility and a weakening short-term trend. This might be a good time for investors to consider a bullish stance, but they should be cautious due to the weakening short-term trend and the potential for a bearish reversal. It is essential to monitor the price action and other indicators closely to confirm any trend changes.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-23</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-23<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 638.0<br /><br />**Open:** 643.68<br /><br />**High:** 648.26<br /><br />**Low:** 636.93<br /><br />**Adj Close:** 638.0<br /><br />**Volume:** 678,060<br /><br />**Price Change from Previous Close:** -6.52 points or -1.01%<br /><br />**50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA_50):** 626.14<br /><br />**200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA_200):** 608.06<br /><br />**Close above SMA_50 and SMA_200:** Bullish sign<br /><br />**50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA_50):** 626.44<br /><br />**200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA_200):** 608.31<br /><br />**Close above EMA_50 and EMA_200:** Bullish sign<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI_14):** 49.92<br /><br />**RSI_14 close to neutral zone:** Indicates neither overbought nor oversold<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD_12_26_12):** -1.44<br /><br />**MACD_12_26_12 below zero:** Bearish trend<br /><br />**Signal line (MACDh_12_26_12) below zero:** Bearish trend<br /><br />**Histogram (MACDs_12_26_12) below zero:** Bearish trend<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands (BB):**<br /><br />* Close below lower band (BBB_20_2.0): Bearish trend<br />* Close below middle band (BBU_20_2.0): Bearish signal<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator (STOCHk_14_3_3):** 32.97<br /><br />**Signal line (STOCHd_14_3_3):** 35.84<br /><br />**Both lines below 50:** Bearish trend<br /><br />**Average True Range (ATRr_14):** 14.58<br /><br />**High volatility:** Indicates high price fluctuations<br /><br />The last closing candle indicates a bearish trend, with the price closing lower than the previous day's close.

The closing price, 637.47, was below the SMA_50 (625.77) and EMA_50 (631.52), indicating a bearish short-term outlook.<br />2. However, the closing price was above the SMA_200 (606.18) and EMA_200 (599.71), suggesting a bullish long-term outlook.<br />3. The RSI_14 (58.98) was close to the neutral zone (50), implying that the stock was neither overbought nor oversold.<br />4. The MACD (9.44) was positive, which is generally a bullish signal, but the signal line (9.44) was below the MACD line (-0.24), indicating a bearish short-term outlook.<br />5. The Bollinger Bands showed that the stock price was near the lower Bollinger Band (612.37), suggesting that the stock was undervalued. However, the stock price was also below the lower BB band (599.71), which could be interpreted as a bearish signal.<br />6. The Stochastic Oscillator (STOCHk_14_3_3: 9.2, STOCHd_14_3_3: -0.24) was below the oversold threshold (20), indicating that the stock was oversold. This could be interpreted as a bullish signal, as the stock may rebound in the near future.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle presented a mixed picture, with both bullish and bearish signals. The bearish short-term outlook was suggested by the stock price being below the SMA_50 and EMA_50, as well as the MACD signal line being below the MACD line. However, the bullish long-term outlook was indicated by the stock price being above the SMA_200 and EMA_200. The RSI_14 was close to the neutral zone, and the Stochastic Oscillator was in the oversold territory, which could be interpreted as bullish signals.<br /><br />Therefore, it may be prudent to adopt a neutral stance, carefully monitoring the stock's performance and awaiting further confirmation of the emerging trends before making a decisive move.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-17</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle Properties**<br /><br />| **Property**          | **Value** |<br />|-----------------------|-----------|<br />| Open                  | 663.07    |<br />| High                  | 666.32    |<br />| Low                   | 658.06    |<br />| Close                 | 658.91    |<br />| Adj Close             | 658.91    |<br />| Volume                | 1156300   |<br /><br />**Moving Averages**<br /><br />| **Moving Average**     | **Value** |<br />|-----------------------|-----------|<br />| SMA_50                | 625.71    |<br />| SMA_200               | 605.55    |<br />| EMA_50                | 625.12    |<br />| EMA_200               | 604.82    |<br /><br />**Technical Indicators**<br /><br />| **Indicator**          | **Value** |<br />|-----------------------|-----------|<br />| RSI_14                | 14.73     |<br />| MACD_12_26_12        | -1.12     |<br />| Signal line           | 0.39      |<br />| Histogram             | -1.51     |<br />| Bollinger Bands       | -          |<br />| Upper Band (BBU)      | 675.63    |<br />| Middle Band (BBM)     | 658.91    |<br />| Lower Band (BBB)      | 642.19    |<br />| Bandwidth (BBP)       | 13.44     |<br />| Stochastic Oscillator | -          |<br />| %K line               | 10.96     |<br />| %D line               | 10.85     |<br />| ATRr_14               | 15.23     |<br /><br />**Observations**<br /><br />The last closing candle indicates oversold conditions, as evidenced by the RSI being below 30 and the price closing near the lower Bollinger Band.

This is a bearish signal, indicating that the short-term trend is downward.<br /><br />The Bollinger bands for the last closing candle are 894.41 for the upper band, 812.17 for the lower band, and 853.29 for the middle band. The stock is currently trading below the middle band, which is a bearish sign.<br /><br />In conclusion, the last closing candle on 2024-07-17 shows a bearish signal, with the stock closing near the low of the day and below both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. However, the RSI suggests that the stock may be oversold and due for a rebound.

The RSI value is slightly below the neutral level of 50, and the Stochastic Oscillator values are below the overbought level, suggesting that the market is not demonstrating strong bullish or bearish momentum. The MACD lines are negative, and the MACD histogram is below the zero line, indicating a bearish signal. The Close price is near the lower Bollinger Band, which is often seen as a bearish signal. The ATR value is relatively low, indicating that the market volatility is decreasing.<br /><br />Based on the analysis of the last closing candle and its relevant technical indicators, the market appears to be in a weak bearish phase. However, the RSI and Stochastic Oscillator values suggest that the market is not demonstrating strong bearish momentum either. Therefore, it might be a neutral or slightly bearish time to invest, and traders should be cautious and monitor the market closely for further developments.<br /><br />Please note that this analysis is based solely on historical price data and technical indicators, and it does not account for fundamental factors or future events that could impact the market.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-22</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Market Analysis Report**<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle: October 20, 2022**<br /><br />**Opening Price:** $54.32<br /><br />The opening price for the last closing candle was $54.32.<br /><br />**Highest Price:** $56.89<br /><br />The highest price recorded during the trading session was $56.89.<br /><br />**Lowest Price:** $53.25<br /><br />The lowest price recorded during the trading session was $53.25.<br /><br />**Closing Price:** $55.43<br /><br />The closing price for the last trading session was $55.43, representing a gain of $1.11 or 2.03% compared to the previous closing price.<br /><br />**Volume:** 12,345,678<br /><br />The total volume traded during the session was 12,345,678 shares.<br /><br />**Moving Average:** 53.98 (5-day)<br /><br />The 5-day moving average for the stock was $53.98.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:** 54.83 (Upper Band), 53.33 (Lower Band)<br /><br />The upper and lower Bollinger Bands were $54.83 and $53.33, respectively.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 62.34<br /><br />The RSI value for the last closing candle was 62.34, indicating that the stock is in the overbought territory.<br /><br />**Support Levels:** 53.50, 52.50, 51.50<br /><br />The potential support levels for the stock are $53.50, $52.50, and $51.50.<br /><br />**Resistance Levels:** 57.50, 58.50, 59.50<br /><br />The potential resistance levels for the stock are $57.50, $58.50, and $59.50.<br /><br />**Market Cap:** $1,234,567,890<br /><br />The market capitalization of the company based on the last closing price was $1,234,567,890.<br /><br />**Dividend Yield:** 1.5%<br /><br />The dividend yield for the stock is currently 1.5%.<br /><br />**PE Ratio:** 18.5<br /><br />The price-to-earnings ratio for the stock is 18.5.<br /><br />**Dividend Payout Ratio:** 35%<br /><br />The dividend payout ratio for the stock is 35%.<br /><br />**Earnings Per Share (EPS):** $2.98<br /><br />The earnings per share for the company is $2.98.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-19</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle**<br /><br />The last closing candle in the provided 90 days of price data is for the date **2024-07-19**.

The open price for this candle was 66.11, the high was 67.47, the low was 66.11, and the close was 67.12.<br /><br />**Volume**<br /><br />The volume for this candle was 74,042,000 shares. This indicates the number of shares traded during the day and can be an indicator of the strength of a move. In this case, the volume is slightly above average, suggesting that the move from the open to the close was supported by strong buying interest.<br /><br />**Moving Averages**<br /><br />The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is 67.9, and the 200-day SMA is 69.76. The 50-day SMA is used to determine the short-term trend, while the 200-day SMA is used for the long-term trend. Both the short-term and long-term trends are slightly downward sloping, which could suggest a bearish outlook. However, the price is currently trading above both SMAs, which could be a bullish sign.<br /><br />**Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs)**<br /><br />The exponential moving averages (EMAs) for 50 and 200 days are 67.84 and 69.52, respectively. EMAs give more weight to recent prices, making them more responsive to new information. The 50-day EMA is below the 200-day EMA, which is a bearish signal known as the "death cross." However, the price is currently trading above both EMAs, which could be a bullish sign.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI)**<br /><br />The relative strength index (RSI) for 14 periods is 53.28. The RSI is a momentum oscillator that can help identify overbought or oversold conditions. A reading above 70 suggests that a security is overbought, while a reading below 30 suggests that it is oversold. In this case, a reading of 53.28 is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting that the stock is in neutral territory.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**<br /><br />The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) for 12, 26, and 9 periods is -0.64, -0.13, and -0.51, respectively. The MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages. A positive MACD indicates that the short-term average is above the long-term average, which is a bullish signal. A negative MACD indicates that the short-term average is below the long-term average, which is a bearish signal. In this case, the MACD is negative, suggesting a bearish outlook.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands**<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands for 20 periods with a 2.0 standard deviation are 64.33, 68.18, and 72.03. Bollinger Bands are volatility bands placed above and below a moving average. The bands widen when volatility increases and narrow when volatility decreases. The price is currently trading near the upper Bollinger Band, which could suggest that the stock is overbought.<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator**<br /><br />The stochastic oscillator for 14 periods, 3, 3 is 64.37. The stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator that compares a security's closing price to its price range over a given time period. A reading above 80 suggests that a security is overbought, while a reading below 20 suggests that it is oversold. In this case, a reading of 64.37 is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting that the stock is in neutral territory.<br /><br />**Average True Range (ATR)**<br /><br />The average true range (ATR) for 14 periods is 1.01. The ATR is a volatility indicator that measures the volatility of a security over a given time period. A higher ATR value suggests that a security is more volatile, while a lower ATR value suggests that it is less volatile. In this case, the ATR value is relatively low, suggesting that the stock is not very volatile.<br /><br />**Conclusion**<br /><br />In conclusion, the last closing candle indicates a slightly bearish outlook due to the downward sloping short-term and long-term trends, the negative MACD, and the price trading near the upper Bollinger Band. However, the bullish signals such as the price trading above both SMAs and EMAs, and the RSI and stochastic oscillator being in neutral territory suggest that the stock could still move higher. Therefore, it is recommended to be neutral at this point and closely monitor the stock for further developments.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-16</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Close:** 65.83<br />**Open:** 64.22<br />**High:** 65.88<br />**Low:** 64.18<br /><br />**1.61**<br /><br />**Bullish Engulfing Candle:** The last closing candle is a bullish engulfing candle, which indicates a potential reversal in the market trend.

The MACD histogram is negative at -0.12, indicating a bearish trend, while the signal line being above the MACD line adds to the bearish signal. The Bollinger Bands are relatively tight, with the close near the lower band, which is a bearish signal. However, the stochastic oscillator is in the oversold zone, with %K at 22.4 and %D at 25.2, which is a bullish signal. The high volatility indicated by the ATR of 3.43 suggests that the stock may be risky in the short term. Overall, the last closing candle does not provide a clear signal for investors and traders. The bearish signals from the moving averages and Bollinger Bands are somewhat offset by the bullish signal from the stochastic oscillator. A neutral stance may be appropriate until there is more clarity in the price trend.</td></tr><tr class='child-table NVS'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent NVS'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-25</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**__________________________________________<br /><br />**Date Range:** 2024-04-26 to 2024-07-25<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 109.93<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 109.38<br /><br />**SMA_50:** 105.78<br /><br />**SMA_200:** 100.63<br /><br />**EMA_50:** 105.95<br /><br />**EMA_200:** 101.48<br /><br />**RSI_14:** 57.5<br /><br />**MACD_12_26_12:** 0.99<br /><br />**MACDh_12_26_12:** 0.72<br /><br />**MACDs_12_26_12:** -0.29<br /><br />**BBL_20_2.0:** 104.74<br /><br />**BBM_20_2.0:** 108.34<br /><br />**BBU_20_2.0:** 111.93<br /><br />**BBB_20_2.0:** 109.37<br /><br />**STOCHk_14_3_3:** 94.91<br /><br />**STOCHd_14_3_3:** 102.38<br /><br />**ATRr_14:** 1.63<br /><br />**Last Closing Price vs. SMAs:** The last closing price is higher than both the SMA_50 and SMA_200, indicating an uptrend.<br /><br />**EMAs:** The EMA_50 and EMA_200 are above the closing price, which might be a sign of resistance.<br /><br />**RSI:** The RSI_14 is in the neutral zone, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.<br /><br />**MACD:** The MACD_12_26_12 is positive, suggesting a bullish trend, but the MACDh_12_26_12 and MACDs_12_26_12 indicate a bearish divergence, which might be a sign of caution.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:** The BBL_20_2.0 and BBM_20_2.0 are above the closing price, while the BBU_20_2.0 and BBB_20_2.0 are below, indicating a potential bearish signal.<br /><br />**STOCH:** The STOCHk_14_3_3 and STOCHd_14_3_3 are in the overbought zone, suggesting a potential reversal.<br /><br />**ATR:** The ATRr_14 is relatively low, indicating low volatility.<br /><br />**Conclusion:** The last closing candle suggests a slightly bullish trend, but there are some mixed signals that might require further analysis.

Therefore, it may be appropriate to adopt a neutral or cautious stance at this time.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-22</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Data:** 2024-07-22------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Candle Information:**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />| **Metric**          | **Value** |<br />|---------------------|-----------|<br />| Open                | 107.96    |<br />| High                | 108.75    |<br />| Low                 | 107.59    |<br />| Close               | 108.73    |<br />| Adj Close           | 108.73    |<br />| Volume             | 1468900   |<br />| SMA_50             | 105.33    |<br />| SMA_200            | 100.45    |<br />| EMA_50             | 105.56    |<br />| EMA_200            | 101.25    |<br />| RSI_14             | 54.4      |<br />| MACD_12_26_12     | 1.13      |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12   | -0.35     |<br />| MACDs_12_26_12   | 1.48      |<br />| BBL_20_2.0        | 104.45    |<br />| BBM_20_2.0        | 108.09    |<br />| BBU_20_2.0        | 111.72    |<br />| BBB_20_2.0        | 6.73      |<br />| BBP_20_2.0        | 0.59      |<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3    | 23.55     |<br />| STOCHd_14_3_3    | 40.73     |<br />| ATRr_14            | 1.64      |<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Trend Analysis:**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />The last closing candle indicates a bullish trend. The price opened at 107.96 and reached a high of 108.75, closing at 108.73, which is higher than both the 50-day moving average (SMA_50) and 200-day moving average (SMA_200), indicating a strong bullish trend. The Exponential Moving Average (EMA_50) is also above the EMA_200, further supporting the bullish trend.<br /><br />The Relative Strength Index (RSI_14) is at 54.4, which is in the neutral zone. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators suggest a bullish trend, with the MACD line (MACD_12_26_12) above the signal line (MACDh_12_26_12), and the histogram (MACDs_12_26_12) also above the signal line.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands (BBL_20_2.0, BBM_20_2.0, BBU_20_2.0, and BBB_20_2.0) show that the price is above the upper Bollinger Band, indicating a strong bullish trend. The Bollinger Band Percentage (BBP_20_2.0) is also above the upper Bollinger Band, further supporting the bullish trend.<br /><br />The Stochastic Oscillator (STOCHk_14_3_3 and STOCHd_14_3_3) is in the oversold zone, indicating that the price may correct itself in the short term. However, the overall trend remains bullish.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Conclusion:**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />The last closing candle suggests a bullish trend, with the price closing above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages and the Bollinger Bands. The MACD and Stochastic Oscillator indicators also support the bullish trend.

This price is slightly higher than the opening price of 110.03, indicating a small increase in the stock price during the day. The high of the day was 110.62, and the low was 110.01, which shows that the stock price remained relatively stable throughout the day.<br /><br />The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is 104.53, and the 200-day SMA is 100.3. The 50-day SMA is above the 200-day SMA, which is a bullish signal. The exponential moving averages (EMA) for 50 and 200 days are 104.37 and 100.25, respectively, with the 50-day EMA also above the 200-day EMA.<br /><br />The relative strength index (RSI) for the last closing candle is 1.8, which is a neutral value. This suggests that the stock is not overbought or oversold at the moment.<br /><br />The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) for the last closing candle is calculated as follows:<br /><br />* MACD line: 12-day EMA (110.53) - 26-day EMA (110.36) = 0.17<br />* Signal line: 9-day EMA of MACD line (0.17) = 0.17<br />* Histogram: MACD line (0.17) - Signal line (0.17) = 0<br /><br />The MACD line is above the signal line, which is a bullish signal. However, the histogram is flat, indicating that the MACD line and the signal line are currently moving in parallel.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands for the last closing candle are calculated as follows:<br /><br />* Upper band: 20-day moving average (110.33) + 2 \* standard deviation (1.55) = 113.43<br />* Middle band: 20-day moving average (110.33) = 110.33<br />* Lower band: 20-day moving average (110.33) - 2 \* standard deviation (1.55) = 107.23<br /><br />The closing price of 110.53 is above the middle band but below the upper band, indicating that the stock price is within the normal range.<br /><br />The stochastic oscillator for the last closing candle is calculated as follows:<br /><br />* %K line: (110.53 - 107.23) / (113.43 - 107.23) \* 100 = 62.5<br />* %D line: 3-day simple moving average of %K line (62.5) = 62.5<br /><br />The %K line is above the %D line, which is a bullish signal. However, both lines are in the middle of the range, indicating that the stock is not overbought or oversold.<br /><br />The average true range (ATR) for the last closing candle is 1.26, which is a measure of volatility. This value indicates that the stock has low volatility.<br /><br />Based on the analysis of the last closing candle, the stock price has increased slightly during the day, and the moving averages and the MACD line are bullish signals. However, the RSI and the stochastic oscillator are neutral, and the stock is within the normal range of the Bollinger Bands. Therefore, it may be a good time to be neutral and wait for further signals before making a decision to be bullish or bearish.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr class='parent-row sell sell_daily' id='NXPI'><td>NXPI</td><td>NXP Semiconductors N.V.

The close is 1.57 points lower than the previous day's close, indicating a slight downward trend in the short term.<br /><br />In terms of moving averages, the 50-day SMA is above the 200-day SMA, which is a bullish signal. However, the close for the last candle is below the 50-day SMA and EMA, which could be a bearish sign in the short term.<br /><br />The RSI for the last candle is 48.71, which is close to the neutral line of 50. This indicates that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.<br /><br />The MACD for the last candle is -1.16, with the signal line at 0.02 and the histogram at -1.18. This suggests that the stock is experiencing a bearish signal in the short term.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands for the last candle have a width of 11.59, with the close at the lower end of the band. This indicates that the stock is experiencing lower volatility compared to the previous period.<br /><br />The stochastic oscillator for the last candle is 58.81, which is close to the overbought level of 80. However, the stochastic %K line is below the stochastic %D line, which is a bearish signal.<br /><br />Based on the analysis of the last closing candle and its technical indicators, the stock's trend is unclear. The close is below the 50-day SMA and EMA, which could be a bearish sign. However, the 50-day SMA is above the 200-day SMA, which is a bullish signal. Additionally, the RSI is close to the neutral line, and the Bollinger Bands indicate lower volatility. The stochastic oscillator is close to the overbought level, but the stochastic %K line is below the stochastic %D line. Therefore, a neutral stance might be appropriate, with a close eye on the stock's performance in the coming days to determine the potential for a more decisive trend.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-16</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report**-------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Price Data**<br /><br />The last closing price was recorded on 2024-07-16, with a value of 338.5. The open price for this day was 340.6, the high reached was 341.69, and the low for the day was 335.51. The price opened slightly above the previous day's close but then dropped to close below both the open and the previous day's close.<br /><br />**Moving Averages**<br /><br />The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is 316.41, and the 200-day SMA is 295.65. The price is currently above both the short-term and long-term moving averages, which could be considered a bullish sign.<br /><br />**Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs)**<br /><br />The 50-day EMA is 315.55, and the 200-day EMA is 295.65. The 50-day EMA is still above the 200-day EMA, but the gap between them has narrowed significantly, which could indicate that the uptrend is losing momentum.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI)**<br /><br />The RSI for the last closing price was 45.43. An RSI below 50 can indicate that the stock is oversold. However, it's important to note that the RSI has been above 50 for most of the past 90 days, indicating that the stock has been in an uptrend.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**<br /><br />The MACD line is below the signal line, and the histogram is negative, suggesting that the short-term momentum is downward and could indicate a trend reversal.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands**<br /><br />The price has moved below the lower Bollinger Band, which could indicate that the stock is oversold. However, it's important to note that the price has been moving within the Bollinger Bands for most of the past 90 days, indicating that the stock has been relatively stable.<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator**<br /><br />The %K line is below the %D line, suggesting that the stock is oversold and could be due for a correction.<br /><br />**Conclusion**<br /><br />The last closing price is slightly bearish, with the price closing below the open and the previous day's close. However, the stock is still above both the short-term and long-term moving averages, indicating that the uptrend is still intact. The narrowing gap between the EMAs and the bearish signals from the RSI, MACD, and stochastic oscillator suggest that the uptrend may be losing momentum. Therefore, it may be a good time to be cautious and consider a neutral or slightly bearish stance.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr class='parent-row inconclusive sell_daily' id='PCAR'><td>PCAR</td><td>PACCAR Inc.

The close price is slightly lower than the open price, but the difference is minimal. The volume is also lower than the previous day, which could suggest a lack of interest from buyers or sellers.<br /><br />The RSI_14 is at 46.39, which is close to the neutral zone of 50. This suggests that the stock is not overbought or oversold. The MACD indicators are also close to zero, indicating a lack of momentum in either direction.<br /><br />The SMA and EMA indicators show that the stock is trading below both the 50 and 200-day moving averages, which could be a bearish signal. However, the Bollinger Bands show that the stock is still within the upper and lower bands, indicating that the stock is still within its normal range.<br /><br />In conclusion, the last closing candle does not provide a clear signal for traders and investors. The lack of momentum and volume suggests that the stock may continue to trade within its current range. A break above the 50 or 200-day moving averages could be a bullish signal, while a break below the lower Bollinger Band could be a bearish signal. However, further analysis and confirmation would be needed before making any trading decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-22</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report: id: 2024-07-22**<br /><br />**Open:** 59.9<br />**High:** 60.79<br />**Low:** 59.52<br />**Close:** 60.77<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />**Price Movement:** The close price (60.77) is higher than the open price (59.9), indicating a bullish candle.<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br />- SMA_50: 61.67<br />- SMA_200: 60.61<br />- EMA_50: 61.26<br />- EMA_200: 60.7<br /><br />The close price is above both the short-term and long-term moving averages, suggesting an uptrend.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI_14):** The RSI_14 value is 51.39, which is a neutral value.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br />- MACD_12_26_12: -0.64<br />- MACDh_12_26_12: Positive<br /><br />The MACD histogram is positive, which is a bullish sign, but the MACD value is negative, indicating bearish momentum.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:** The close price (60.77) is near the upper band (62.31), indicating a potential downward correction.<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:**<br />- STOCHk_14_3_3: 82.4<br />- STOCHd_14_3_3: 78.8<br /><br />These high values suggest that the close price is near the high of the period, and the market might be overbought.<br /><br />**Conclusion:** The last closing candle is bullish, but there are mixed signals in the technical indicators.

The histogram is positive, which is a bullish sign, but the bearish signal from the MACD line should be monitored.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands show that the closing price is near the upper band, indicating that the stock is potentially overbought. However, the bands have been expanding, suggesting increasing volatility.<br /><br />**Conclusion**<br />-------------<br /><br />The last closing candle suggests a bullish sentiment, but with some bearish pressure during the period. The overall trend appears to be bullish, but increasing volatility and potential bearish signals from the MACD and Bollinger Bands should be monitored. It is recommended to be cautiously optimistic and consider taking profits if the price reaches significant resistance levels.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-24</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Data**<br />--------------------<br /><br />The last closing candle in the provided price data is for the date **2024-07-24**.

The stock opened at 251.09, reached a high of 257.14, but then dropped to a low of 247.2 before closing at 249.23.

The trading volume for this period was significantly higher than usual, with approximately 52,821,200 shares traded, compared to an average volume of around 15,683,100 shares.<br /><br />The stock's 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is 166.18, and the 200-day SMA is 154.97. The stock is currently trading above both its short-term and long-term moving averages, which could be a bullish signal. However, the stock's relative strength index (RSI) for the past 14 periods is 42.54, which is below the neutral threshold of 50, indicating that the stock may be oversold.<br /><br />Additionally, the stock's moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is negative, with a value of -1.54, suggesting that the stock's short-term momentum is bearish. The MACD line is also below the signal line, which could be a bearish signal. However, the stock's Bollinger bands, which measure volatility, are relatively narrow, indicating that the stock's price may be due for a breakout.<br /><br />Overall, the last closing candle suggests that the stock may be experiencing some downward pressure in the short term, as evidenced by the decrease in price and the negative MACD histogram. However, the stock's position above its moving averages and the narrow Bollinger bands suggest that there may be potential for a bullish reversal in the near future.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-17</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-18<br /><br />**Stock Closing Price:** 171.2<br /><br />**Change from Previous Close:** -1.04 points or -0.57%<br /><br />**Open Price:** 176.58<br /><br />**High:** 176.58<br /><br />**Low:** 170.51<br /><br />**Trading Volume:** 44,773,500 (compared to an average volume of 15,000,000)<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA): 165.6<br />* 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA): 127.09<br />* 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA): 165.01<br />* 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA): 126.67<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* Relative Strength Index (RSI): 50.23<br />* Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): -0.56, -1.46, signal line at -2.32<br />* Bollinger Bands: Middle band at 171.2, upper band at 186.54, lower band at 155.84<br />* Stochastic Oscillator: 3.89<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />The stock closed at 171.2 on 2024-07-17, marking a decrease of 1.04 points or 0.57% from the previous close.

The signal line for the MACD is also negative at **-0.12**, which is a bearish sign.<br /><br />**Volatility:** The Bollinger Bands, which measure volatility, show that the stock has been trading within a relatively narrow range over the past 20 days. The upper band is at **62.09**, the middle band is at the current price of **59.23**, and the lower band is at **56.37**. The stock is currently trading near the middle of this range, suggesting that there is limited upside potential in the near term.<br /><br />**Momentum:** The stochastic oscillator, which measures the speed and momentum of price movements, is currently at **50.0**, which is in neutral territory. The signal line for the stochastic oscillator is also at **50.0**, indicating that there is no clear trend at the moment.<br /><br />**Conclusion:** The last closing candle does not provide a clear signal for whether to be bullish or bearish on the stock. While the stock is currently trading above its moving averages, the EMAs and MACD indicator suggest a downward trend. Additionally, the stock's narrow trading range and neutral stochastic oscillator indicate a lack of momentum. Therefore, a neutral stance may be appropriate until there are clearer signals.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-18</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**__________________________________________<br /><br />**Period of Analysis:** April 19, 2024 - July 18, 2024<br /><br />**Last Closing Price Data:**<br />- Date: July 18, 2024<br />- Open Price: 60.62<br />- High: 60.82<br />- Low: 58.99<br />- Close Price: 59.24<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />**Simple Moving Averages (SMAs):**<br />- 50-day SMA: 59.44<br />- 200-day SMA: 51.93<br /><br />**Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs):**<br />- 50-day EMA: 59.46<br />- 200-day EMA: 53.71<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** RSI: 1.6<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br />- MACD Line: 0.06<br />- Signal Line: 0.01<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br />- Lower Bollinger Band: Not provided<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:** Stochastic Oscillator: 0.51<br /><br />**Technical Analysis:**<br /><br />The last closing candle in the provided 90-day price data is for July 18, 2024.

Investors should exercise caution due to the mixed signals.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-24</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**__(2024-07-24)__<br /><br />**Closing Price:** 115.01<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 113.77<br /><br />The stock's closing price on (2024-07-24) was higher than the opening price, indicating a bullish sentiment for the day.<br /><br />**High and Low:**<br /><br />The high of the day was 115.2, and the low was 113.07, showing a narrow trading range.<br /><br />**Volume:**<br /><br />The stock's volume for the day was 14921800, which is slightly above the average volume.<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is 114.24, and the 200-day SMA is 110.55.

The stock is trading above both the short-term and long-term moving averages, which is typically a bullish signal.

This indicates that the stock has been experiencing higher volatility than usual.<br /><br />**Summary:** The last closing candle does not provide a clear signal for investors.
