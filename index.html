Closing Price:** The stock closed higher than the opening price, which can be seen as a positive sign. However, the closing price is slightly lower than the previous day's close ($236.18), indicating some weakness.<br /><br />**2. Trading Volume:** The trading volume on July 15, 2024, is lower than the 90-day average volume (64,710,600), suggesting decreased interest from investors.<br /><br />**3. Moving Averages:**<br /><br />- 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA): $202.3<br />- 200-day SMA: $188.04<br /><br />The stock is trading above both moving averages, which is typically a bullish sign. However, the Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) show that the 50-day EMA is below the 200-day EMA, indicating a potential bearish trend in the short term.<br /><br />**4. Relative Strength Index (RSI):** The RSI for the last closing candle is 49.23, which is close to the neutral level of 50. This indicates that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.<br /><br />**5. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** The MACD line is below the signal line, indicating a potential bearish signal.<br /><br />**6. Bollinger Bands:** The stock price is near the lower Bollinger Band, which can be seen as a bearish sign. However, the price is still within the bands, so it is not yet considered an extreme condition.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />Based on the analysis of the last closing candle and its technical details, it appears that the stock market is currently in a neutral to slightly bearish phase. While the stock is trading above both moving averages, the decreased trading volume, lower close compared to the previous day, and bearish signals from the RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands suggest caution for potential buyers. Investors should carefully monitor the stock's performance and consider additional technical and fundamental analysis before making investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-12</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-12<br /><br />**Closing Price:** 230.54<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 228.92<br /><br />**High of the Day:** 232.64<br /><br />**Low of the Day:** 228.68<br /><br />**Bullish Indicators:**<br /><br />* Closing price is higher than opening price and both short-term and long-term moving averages.<br />* RSI is below oversold threshold, indicating the stock is not overbought.<br />* MACD line is above signal line, indicating a bullish signal.<br />* Bollinger Bands show closing price near upper band, indicating strong uptrend.<br />* Stochastic oscillator %K line is above %D line, indicating a bullish signal.<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* 50-day SMA: 201.0<br />* 200-day SMA: 185.95<br />* 50-day EMA: 201.0<br />* 200-day EMA: 185.95<br />* RSI: 8.6<br />* MACD line: 7.69<br />* Signal line: 0.9<br />* %K line: 8.57<br />* %D line: 1.04<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />The closing price on July 12, 2024, was higher than the opening price, indicating a potential bullish sentiment.

This could potentially lead to a price correction.<br />* The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is positive but losing momentum, which might suggest a trend reversal in the near future.<br />* Both the Stochastic Oscillator and Stochastic %D are above 80, further supporting the overbought conditions.<br /><br />Despite the bullish candle, the overbought conditions and loss of momentum in the MACD warrant caution. It might be prudent to remain neutral and wait for a confirmation of the trend before making any bullish or bearish decisions.</td></tr><tr

At the moment, it might be best to adopt a neutral-to-cautiously bearish stance, but closely monitor the stock for potential bullish signals.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-12</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-12<br /><br />**Closing Price:** **253.97**<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 251.62<br /><br />**Bullish Indicators:**<br /><br />- Closing price higher than opening price<br />- Close near the high of the day<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| **Indicator**          | **Value** |<br />|-----------------------|-----------|<br />| Adj Close              | 253.97    |<br />| Volume                | 4705000   |<br />| SMA_50                | 257.4     |<br />| SMA_200              | 259.16    |<br />| EMA_50               | 257.4     |<br />| EMA_200              | 259.16    |<br />| RSI_14               | 56.78     |<br />| MACD_12_26_12       | -0.54     |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12      | 0.67      |<br />| BBL_20_2.0          | 230.83    |<br />| BBM_20_2.0          | 251.66    |<br />| BBU_20_2.0          | 272.48    |<br />| BBW_20_2.0          | 41.65     |<br />| BBP_20_2.0          | 16.55     |<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3       | 92.62     |<br />| STOCHd_14_3_3       | 92.62     |<br />| ATRr_14              | 6.69      |<br /><br />**Bearish Indicators:**<br /><br />- MACD below signal line<br />- Stochastic Oscillator above overbought level<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />The last closing candle on 2024-07-12 indicates a bullish sentiment, with the stock closing higher than the opening price and near the high of the day.

The following technical indicators were analyzed to gain a more informed perspective on the market.<br /><br />**Simple Moving Averages (SMA):**<br /><br />The 50-day SMA was 155.15, and the 200-day SMA was 155.08. The closing price being above both short-term and long-term SMAs is a bullish sign.<br /><br />**Exponential Moving Averages (EMA):**<br /><br />The 50-day EMA was 155.21, and the 200-day EMA was 155.1. The closing price being above both EMAs is also a bullish indicator.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):**<br /><br />The 14-period RSI was 47.81, which is close to the neutral zone (50). This indicates that the asset is not overbought or oversold, leaving room for price movement in either direction.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />The MACD line was -0.02, and the signal line was 0.01. The MACD line being below the signal line is typically a bearish sign. However, the difference between the two lines was minimal, suggesting that the bearish signal was weak.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />The closing price was near the lower Bollinger Band, indicating that the price may have been oversold in the short term. However, the price remained within the bands, suggesting that the overall trend was still intact.<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:**<br /><br />The 14-period %K line was 45.62, and the 14-period %D line was 45.62. Both lines were in the neutral zone (below 80 and above 20), indicating that the asset was not overbought or oversold.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />Based on the analysis of the last closing candle and the technical indicators, the market appears to be in a state of indecision. While the closing price is above the SMAs and EMAs, the MACD and Stochastic Oscillator indicators suggest that the asset may be due for a correction. However, the weak bearish signals and the fact that the price remains within the Bollinger Bands indicate that the overall trend remains bullish. Therefore, it may be a good time to adopt a neutral-to-bullish stance, with a focus on closely monitoring the asset's performance and adjusting positions as necessary. It is essential to consider other market factors and risk management strategies when making investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='child-table CVX'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent CVX'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-15</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-15<br /><br />**Closing Price:** 158.04<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 156.95<br /><br />**High Price:** 159.52<br /><br />**Low Price:** 156.37<br /><br />**Trading Volume:** 5,432,442<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA): 157.97<br />* 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA): 154.23<br />* 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA): 157.41<br />* 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA): 154.23<br />* Relative Strength Index (RSI): 54.89<br />* Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): 0.34<br /><br />**Trend Analysis:**<br /><br />* The closing price is higher than both the 50-day and 200-day SMAs, indicating an uptrend over the past 200 days.<br />* The short-term trend is bullish, as indicated by the 50-day EMA being below the closing price.<br />* The long-term trend is still positive but less so, as indicated by the 200-day EMA being below both the opening and closing prices.<br /><br />**Oscillator Analysis:**<br /><br />* The RSI is in the neutral zone at 54.89.<br />* The MACD is positive at 0.34, indicating a bullish trend.<br />* The Stochastic Oscillator is at 31.5, which is in the oversold zone, suggesting a potential correction.<br />* However, the Stochastic %K is above the Stochastic %D, indicating that the stock is still in an uptrend.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />* The stock price is within the upper band, indicating that it is trading near the high end of its recent range.<br />* The Bandwidth is 2.61, which is relatively narrow, suggesting low volatility.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle indicates a slightly bullish trend, with the stock trading near the high end of its recent range.

This candle is a **bullish candle**, as the closing price is higher than the opening price, and it has a long upper wick, indicating that the price attempted to reach higher levels but was pushed down towards the close.<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* **Simple Moving Averages (SMA):** The 50-day SMA is **337.11**, and the 200-day SMA is **305.67**. The fact that the closing price is above both the short-term and long-term moving averages is a **bullish sign**.<br />* **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA):** The 50-day EMA is **336.52**, and the 200-day EMA is **305.58**. Similar to the SMA, the closing price is above both the short-term and long-term EMAs, which is a **bullish sign**.<br />* **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** The 14-day RSI is **65.86**, which is above 50, indicating that the stock is in an uptrend. However, it's not extremely high, so there is still room for further growth.<br />* **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** The MACD line is **15.54**, and the signal line is **15.51**. The MACD line is above the signal line, which is a **bullish sign**.<br />* **Bollinger Bands:** The closing price is near the upper Bollinger Band, indicating that the stock is **overbought**. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the stock will reverse its trend, as the upper Bollinger Band can widen during strong uptrends.<br />* **Stochastic Oscillator:** The 14-day Stochastic Oscillator is **91.52**, which is above 80, indicating that the stock is **overbought**. Similar to the Bollinger Bands, this doesn't necessarily mean that the stock will reverse its trend, but it's a sign that the stock may be due for a correction.<br /><br />**Conclusion:** Based on the analysis of the last closing candle and the technical indicators, we can conclude that the stock is in an uptrend, and the last closing candle is a bullish sign. However, the Stochastic Oscillator and Bollinger Bands suggest that the stock may be overbought, so there is a risk of a correction. Nevertheless, the fact that the closing price is above both the short-term and long-term moving averages and the EMAs is a bullish sign, indicating that the stock may continue its uptrend. Therefore, it may be a good time to be bullish on the stock, but it's important to monitor the Stochastic Oscillator and Bollinger Bands for signs of a correction. Additionally, it's always a good idea to use multiple timeframes and indicators to confirm the trend and make informed investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='child-table HD'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent HD'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-15</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Closing Price** for the last trading day on 2024-07-15 was **358.46**, representing a **1.39% increase** from the previous close.

Additionally, it may be a good idea to wait for a pullback before entering new long positions.</td></tr><tr class='child-table KO'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent KO'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-15</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-15<br /><br />**Closing Price:** 63.41<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 63.79<br /><br />**High:** 63.94<br /><br />**Low:** 63.35<br /><br />**50-day SMA:** 63.03<br /><br />**200-day SMA:** 59.71<br /><br />**50-day EMA:** 63.0<br /><br />**200-day EMA:** 59.46<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 52.89<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />* Signal Line: -0.06<br />* Histogram: -0.3<br />* Line: -0.19<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />* Middle Band: 62.75<br />* Upper Band: 64.08<br />* Lower Band: 61.41<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:**<br /><br />* %K: 62.06<br />* %D: 62.15<br /><br />**Average True Range (ATR):** 0.76<br /><br />**Analysis:**<br /><br />The stock closed at 63.41 on 2024-07-15, with an open of 63.79, a high of 63.94, and a low of 63.35.

The RSI value of 52.89 indicates that the stock is not overbought or oversold.<br /><br />The MACD lines suggest a slightly bearish trend, with the MACD line below the signal line and the histogram showing negative values. However, the ATR value of 0.76 indicates low volatility, which may limit the potential for significant price movements.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands indicate that the stock price is near the middle of the range, with the closing price close to the middle band. The Stochastic Oscillator values of 62.06 for %K and 62.15 for %D are both in the neutral range.<br /><br />Based on this analysis, the last closing candle does not provide a clear indication for bullish or bearish sentiment. The stock price is near the middle of the Bollinger Bands range, and the RSI and SO values are in neutral territory. The MACD lines suggest a slightly bearish trend, but the ATR value indicates low volatility. Therefore, a neutral stance is recommended for this stock.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-12</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle**<br />---------------------<br /><br />The last closing candle in the provided 90 days of price data is for the date **2024-07-12**. The open price was **63.46**, the high was **64.11**, the low was **63.39**, and the close was **63.7**. This represents a **slight increase** from the previous day's close, forming a small up candle.<br /><br />**Volume**<br />---------<br /><br />The volume for this candle was **9199400**, which is **lower than the previous day's volume** and below the 90-day average volume. This lower volume may indicate decreased interest or a lack of conviction among traders and investors.<br /><br />**Moving Averages**<br />------------------<br /><br />The 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is **63.0**, and the 200-day SMA is **62.69**. The 50-day SMA is above the 200-day SMA, indicating an **uptrend**. However, the close for the last candle is slightly below the 50-day SMA, which could be a sign of short-term weakness.<br /><br />The Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) for 50 and 200 days are **63.04** and **62.7**, respectively. The EMAs show a similar trend as the SMAs, with the 50-day EMA above the 200-day EMA. The close for the last candle is above the 200-day EMA, which is a positive sign.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI)**<br />-------------------------------<br /><br />The RSI for the last candle is **50.26**, indicating **neutral momentum**. The RSI has been oscillating around the 50 level for the past few days, suggesting a consolidation phase.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**<br />---------------------------------------------<br /><br />The MACD for the last candle is **-0.04**, with the signal line at **0.01** and the histogram at **-0.05**. The MACD is close to crossing above the signal line, which could be a bullish signal.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands (BB)**<br />-----------------------<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands for the last candle have a width of **2.0**. The close for the last candle is near the upper Bollinger Band, suggesting that the stock is overbought. However, the close is also near the upper Bollinger Band for the previous day, so this may not be a significant signal.<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator (SO)**<br />-----------------------------<br /><br />The SO for the last candle is **37.47**, with the %K line at **27.54** and the %D line at **38.21**. The SO is in the oversold region, indicating that the stock may be due for a rebound.<br /><br />**Conclusion**<br />------------<br /><br />Based on this analysis, the last closing candle does not provide a clear signal for being bullish, bearish, or neutral. The uptrend indicated by the SMAs and EMAs is encouraging, but the lower volume and neutral RSI suggest a consolidation phase. The MACD is close to crossing above the signal line, which could be a bullish signal, but the SO is in the oversold region, indicating a potential rebound. Therefore, it may be prudent to wait for further confirmation before making any investment decisions. Investors and traders should monitor the stock's performance and consider other factors, such as earnings reports and economic indicators, before taking a position.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-11</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Market Analysis Report**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** The last closing price was recorded on 2024-07-11, with a value of **63.1**.<br /><br />**Price Movement:** The open price for the same day was **62.64**, and the high and low prices were **63.46** and **62.4**, respectively. The price opened slightly below the previous day's closing price, then rallied to a new high for the period before dropping back down and ultimately closing higher than it opened.<br /><br />**Moving Averages:** The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is **62.96**, and the 200-day SMA is **61.05**. The 50-day SMA is above the 200-day SMA, which is a **bullish signal**.

However, some of the technical indicators, such as the MACD and stochastic oscillator, are showing bearish signals. Therefore, it may be a good time to be **cautiously bullish**, with a focus on risk management.

This indicates that there was some decent interest in the stock on this day, but it was not an extraordinarily high volume day.<br /><br />**Moving Averages**<br />------------------<br /><br />The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) for the stock is **62.94**, while the 200-day SMA is **59.0**. This means that the stock is currently trading above both its short-term and long-term moving averages, which is a bullish sign. However, the fact that the 50-day SMA is very close to the price of the last closing candle may indicate that the stock is due for a correction in the near future.<br /><br />The exponential moving averages (EMAs) for the past 50 and 200 days are also bullish, with the 50-day EMA at **62.91** and the 200-day EMA at **59.5**. This means that the short-term trend for the stock is up, and it has been for some time.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI)**<br />-------------------------------<br /><br />The RSI for the past 14 days is **47.0**, which is in neutral territory. This means that the stock is not overbought or oversold, and there is no immediate indication of a trend change.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**<br />---------------------------------------------<br /><br />The MACD for the past 12, 26, and 9 days is also in neutral territory, with the signal line and the histogram both hovering around zero. This indicates that there is no clear trend in the stock's momentum at the moment.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands**<br />------------------<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands for the past 20 days are relatively tight, with the upper band at **64.24**, the middle band at **62.83**, and the lower band at **61.42**. This indicates that the stock is currently trading within a narrow range, and any breakout above or below the bands could signal a trend change.<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator**<br />-----------------------<br /><br />The stochastic oscillator for the past 14 days is also in neutral territory, with the %K line at **50.3** and the %D line at **50.0**. This means that the stock is not overbought or oversold, and there is no immediate indication of a trend change.<br /><br />**Conclusion**<br />------------<br /><br />Based on this analysis, the last closing candle does not provide a clear indication of whether the stock is a good buy or not. The stock is currently trading above its short-term and long-term moving averages, which is a bullish sign. However, the small size of the candle's body and the fact that the 50-day SMA is very close to the price may indicate that the stock is due for a correction in the near future. The RSI, MACD, and stochastic oscillator are all in neutral territory, which further complicates the picture. Therefore, it may be wise to wait for a clearer signal before making a decision to buy or sell this stock. Investors could consider waiting for a breakout above or below the Bollinger Bands, or for a clear trend to emerge in the RSI, MACD, or stochastic oscillator. Alternatively, investors could consider looking at other technical or fundamental indicators to help make their decision.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-09</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-09<br /><br />**Closing Price:** $62.69<br /><br />**Change:** $0.34 (-0.54%)<br /><br />**Open Price:** $63.06<br /><br />**High:** $63.23<br /><br />**Low:** $62.59<br /><br />**50-day SMA:** $62.92<br /><br />**200-day SMA:** $59.59<br /><br />**50-day EMA:** $62.92<br /><br />**200-day EMA:** $59.59<br /><br />**14-day RSI:** 45.35<br /><br />**MACD Histogram:** -0.12<br /><br />**MACD Signal Line:** -0.04<br /><br />**MACD Line:** -0.2<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />* Lower Band: $62.41<br />* Middle Band: $62.69<br />* Upper Band: $62.97<br /><br />**Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E):** N/A<br /><br />The **closing price** on July 9, 2024, was $62.69, which represents a decrease of $0.34 or 0.54% compared to the previous closing price.

A conservative approach would be to wait for confirmation of a trend reversal or a break above the 50-day SMA before turning bullish.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-12</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report**__________________________________________<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle (July 12, 2024)**<br /><br />| **Parameter**          | **Value** |<br />|-----------------------|-----------|<br />| Open Price             | 166.22    |<br />| High Price             | 167.64    |<br />| Low Price              | 166.02    |<br />| Close Price            | 166.61    |<br /><br />This candle is a **slightly bullish** candle as the close price is higher than the open price, but the price range is relatively narrow.<br /><br />**Technical Indicators**<br /><br />| **Indicator**          | **Value** |<br />|-----------------------|-----------|<br />| 50-day SMA             | 165.98    |<br />| 200-day SMA            | 159.12    |<br />| 50-day EMA             | 165.84    |<br />| 200-day EMA            | 159.09    |<br />| RSI                    | 50.27     |<br />| MACD Line             | 0.12      |<br />| Signal Line            | 0.08      |<br />| Histogram             | -0.03     |<br />| Bollinger Bands (Middle) | N/A      |<br />| %K Stochastic Oscillator | 50.12     |<br />| %D Stochastic Oscillator | 50.06     |<br />| ATR                    | 2.1       |<br /><br />**Technical Analysis**<br /><br />The **50-day SMA** and **200-day SMA** are both above the current closing price, indicating an **uptrend**.

However, the RSI is at 58.05, which is close to the neutral level of 50, and the MACD histogram is positive but relatively small, indicating that the short-term momentum may be waning.<br /><br />Additionally, the Bollinger Bands are relatively wide, suggesting that the stock price may be volatile in the near term. The price is near the upper Bollinger Band, which could be a bearish sign, but the BBP is also near the upper Bollinger Band, indicating that the price may be overbought but not necessarily overvalued.<br /><br />The Stochastic Oscillator is also indicating that the stock may be overbought, with both the %K and %D lines above 80. However, this could also be a sign of a strong uptrend, so it is important to consider other indicators as well.<br /><br />Overall, the last closing candle does not provide a clear signal for investors. While there are some positive signs, such as the price being above the moving averages, there are also some potential warning signs, such as the overbought indicators. Therefore, it may be best to take a neutral stance and wait for further confirmation of the trend before making any investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-10</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle**<br />---------------------<br /><br />The last closing candle in the provided 90 days of price data is for the date **2024-07-10**.

The volume for this candle is also lower than the previous day, which could indicate decreased interest in the stock.<br /><br />In conclusion, the last closing candle suggests a slightly bearish outlook, but the neutral RSI and positive MACD indicate that the trend is not definitively bearish. It may be a good time for cautious investors to consider entering the market, while more aggressive investors might wait for a clearer trend.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-05</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**____________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-05<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 73.25<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| **Indicator** | **Value** |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| 50-day SMA | 68.8772 |<br />| 200-day SMA | 70.9762 |<br />| 20-day EMA | 73.94 |<br />| Relative Strength Index (RSI) | 51.78 |<br />| Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) |<br />| MACD Line | 0.0565 |<br />| Signal Line | 0.4612 |<br />| Bollinger Bands | Closing price near upper band |<br />| Stochastic Oscillator | 81.72 |<br /><br />**Price Action:**<br /><br />The last closing candle occurred on 2024-07-05 with a closing price of 73.25.

It may be wise to wait for further price action before making a bullish or bearish stance.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-05</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-05<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 488.010009765625<br /><br />**Open Price:** 489.0<br /><br />**High:** 489.6700134277344<br /><br />**Low:** 484.5<br /><br />**Volume:** 3498500<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| **Indicator**          | **Value**                                                 |<br />|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|<br />| 50-day SMA             | 493.4833850209221                                         |<br />| 200-day SMA            | 506.5014122539355                                         |<br />| RSI                    | 27.777309917847216                                         |<br />| MACD Line             | -10.744354152592052                                       |<br />| Signal Line            | -3.4631867482285505                                       |<br />| Bollinger Bands (Lower) | 481.3552338422636                                         |<br />| Bollinger Bands (Upper) | 515.7657852491836                                         |<br />| Stochastic Oscillator | 15.460163760184281                                       |<br />| ATR                   | 13.104416600250564                                         |<br /><br />**Analysis:**<br /><br />The last closing candle in the provided 90 days of price data occurred on 2024-07-05. The open price for this candle was 489.0, and the high and low prices were 489.6700134277344 and 484.5, respectively. The close price was 488.010009765625. This candle is considered bearish as the close price is lower than the open price.<br /><br />The volume for this candle was 3498500, which is above both the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of 493.4833850209221 and the 200-day SMA of 506.5014122539355. This indicates increased trading activity.<br /><br />The 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) is currently above the 200-day EMA, which is a bullish signal. However, the RSI is at 27.777309917847216, which is below 30, indicating oversold conditions. The MACD line is negative, with the MACD line (-10.744354152592052) below the signal line (-3.4631867482285505), which is a bearish signal.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands indicate that the close price is near the lower band, which may suggest a potential rebound. The Stochastic Oscillator is also below 20, indicating oversold conditions. The ATR is relatively high at 13.104416600250564, indicating high volatility.<br /><br />In conclusion, the last closing candle indicates bearish conditions due to the lower close compared to the open and the negative MACD. However, the oversold conditions indicated by the RSI and Stochastic Oscillator suggest a potential rebound. The high volume and the position of the close near the lower Bollinger Band also support this possibility. Therefore, it might be a good time for cautious bullish positions, but it is essential to monitor the market closely for any changes in trends.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr class='parent-row inconclusive inconclusive_daily' id='V'><td>V</td><td>Visa Inc.</td><td>2024-07-12</td><td>neutral</td></tr><tr class='explanation-table V'><td colspan='4'>**Weekly Stock Market Analysis**<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle**<br /><br />The last closing candle in the 90-day price data from the weekly chart is for the week ending on 2024-07-08.
