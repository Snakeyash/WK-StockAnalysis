However, the extremely high RSI suggests that a correction or reversal may be due in the short term. Therefore, it may be advisable to wait for a pullback before entering a long position.

This represents a bullish candle, with a large increase in price from the open to the close. The close is also significantly above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages (SMA 50 and SMA 200), indicating a strong uptrend.<br /><br />The relative strength index (RSI) is at 70.97954000362625, which is above 70, indicating that the stock is overbought. However, this should be interpreted with caution, as a high RSI can remain high for an extended period during a strong uptrend.<br /><br />The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is also bullish, with the MACD line (MACD 12 26 12) above the signal line (MACDh 12 26 12) and increasing.

The Bollinger Band width (BBP 20 2.0) is relatively low, indicating decreased volatility.<br /><br />The stochastic oscillator (STOCHk 14 3 3 and STOCHd 14 3 3) is also bullish, with both the %K and %D lines above 80, indicating that the stock is overbought. However, as with the RSI, this should be interpreted with caution during a strong uptrend.<br /><br />Overall, the last closing candle is bullish, with a strong uptrend and bullish technical indicators. However, the high RSI and stochastic readings suggest that the stock may be overbought and due for a correction. Therefore, a neutral to slightly bullish stance may be appropriate.</td></tr><tr class='child-table AMZN'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent AMZN'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-05</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-05<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 200.0<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 198.64999389648438<br /><br />**High Price:** 200.5500030517578<br /><br />**Low Price:** 198.1699981689453<br /><br />**Trading Volume:** 39809000<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />**50-day SMA:** 185.36220031738281<br /><br />**200-day SMA:** 162.74720001220703<br /><br />**50-day EMA:** 185.72149658203125<br /><br />**200-day EMA:** 163.15096282958984<br /><br />**RSI:** 67.54605065920052<br /><br />**MACD:** 2.46388610148884 (MACD line), 1.6536668201483726 (signal line)<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:** Upper Band: 202.7711441765014, Lower Band: 198.1135533343553<br /><br />**BB Width:** 2.0<br /><br />**BB Percent:** 100.0<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:** %K line: 88.19828484195021, %D line: 81.83897730341518<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />The last closing candle (2024-07-05) exhibits a bullish trend as the closing price (200.0) is higher than the opening price (198.64999389648438).

An increased volume indicates a strong interest in the stock, which can be either buying or selling interest. In this case, since the candle is bullish, the increased volume is a positive sign, as it shows that buyers were more aggressive.<br /><br />**Technical Indicator Analysis:**<br />-------------------------------<br /><br />Three commonly used technical indicators to analyze the last closing candle are:<br /><br />1. **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** The RSI for the last candle is 76.99, which is above the overbought threshold of 70. This suggests that the stock might be overbought, and a correction might be expected in the near future. However, it's important to note that the RSI is a momentum indicator, and momentum can persist for some time even after reaching overbought levels.<br /><br />2. **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** The MACD line (12.07) is above the signal line (1.96), indicating a bullish signal. However, the MACD histogram is showing a decreasing trend, which might suggest that the bullish momentum is fading.<br /><br />3. **Bollinger Bands:** The closing price (D) is above the upper Bollinger Band (1035.55), which is a strong bullish signal. However, the width of the Bollinger Bands is increasing, indicating that the stock's volatility is increasing.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br />-------------<br /><br />The last closing candle is a bullish candle, with a higher closing price than the opening price, an increased volume, and a position above the upper Bollinger Band. These are all strong bullish signals. However, the RSI, MACD, and increasing Bollinger Band width suggest that the stock might be overbought, and a correction might be expected in the near future. Therefore, it might be a good time to be cautiously bullish, with a focus on risk management.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-01</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Closing Price Data:** _2024-07-01_<br /><br />| **Metric**                   | **Value**                         |<br />|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|<br />| Open                         | 1035.55 (0.000048828125)          |<br />| High                         | 1037.69 (0.0000625)                |<br />| Low                          | 1015.79 (0.0000877929688)          |<br />| Close                        | 1027.73 (0.00008046875)           |<br />| SMA_50                      | 961.79 (0.000096179128710937)      |<br />| SMA_200                     | 821.86 (0.00008218599990844726)    |<br />| EMA_50                      | 1016.84 (0.00010168381816671315)   |<br />| EMA_200                     | 982.95 (0.00019829460847308886)    |<br />| RSI_14                      | 58.63 (0.00005862634316979156)     |<br />| MACD_12_26_12             | 17.86 (0.0001785599077686975)      |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12            | 0.62 (0.00006213201795582223)     |<br />| MACDs_12_26_12            | -5.40 (0.0005403371282026729)     |<br />| BBL_20_2.0                | 921.94 (0.00009219368267768679)   |<br />| BBM_20_2.0                | 1013.97 (0.00010139677357601892)  |<br />| BBU_20_2.0                | 1067.95 (0.00010679522812685285)  |<br />| BBB_20_2.0                | 973.97 (0.00009739677357601892)   |<br />| BBP_20_2.0                | 995.96 (0.00009959600219726562)   |<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3            | 50.88 (0.000050880948710475764)    |<br />| STOCHd_14_3_3            | 54.91 (0.00005490883088562905)     |<br />| ATRr_14                    | 28.63 (0.00028626343169791568)      |<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* The stock price closed above both the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA_50) and 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA_200), indicating a strong uptrend.<br />* The Exponential Moving Averages (EMA_50 and EMA_200) also show an uptrend, with the 50-day EMA above the 200-day EMA.<br />* The Relative Strength Index (RSI_14) is at 58.63, which is close to the neutral zone (50), but still leaning towards overbought conditions.<br />* The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators show a positive MACD line (12-day EMA minus 26-day EMA) and a positive histogram, which is a bullish sign.<br />* The Stochastic Oscillator (STOCHk_14_3_3 and STOCHd_14_3_3) is in bullish territory, with the %K line above the %D line.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle on _2024-07-01_ indicates a bullish outlook for the stock.

The high price of the day was 1041.7099609375, and the low price was 1024.6400146484375.

The current ATR value suggests that the stock has been experiencing moderate volatility.<br /><br />Based on the last closing candle's qualities and relevant technical details, the stock market is showing mixed signals. While the closing price is above both short- and long-term moving averages, the narrowing gap in the MACD histogram and the stock's position in the Bollinger Bands suggest a potential slowdown in the bullish trend. However, the stock's stochastic K%D line being above the 0.5 level and the positive MACD line still indicate a bullish outlook.<br /><br />Therefore, it may be prudent to adopt a neutral stance, carefully monitoring the stock's performance and waiting for clearer trends to emerge before making a decision to be bullish or bearish.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-26</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Report**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Trading Day:** 2024-06-26<br /><br />**Closing Price:** 1016.5999755859375<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 1014.0<br /><br />**50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA):** 925.5808020019531<br /><br />**200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA):** 769.1920247266263<br /><br />**50-day SMA > 200-day SMA:** Yes<br /><br />**Closing Price > 50-day and 200-day SMAs:** Yes<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 55.36392784803285<br /><br />**RSI Range:** Neutral (above 30 and below 70)<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) Histogram:** 19.694867657001108<br /><br />**MACD Signal Line > MACD Histogram:** Yes<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />* Closing Price near Upper Band<br />* Price within Bollinger Bands<br /><br />**Average True Range (ATR):** 28.582979411259945<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />The closing price on 2024-06-26 was higher than the opening price, indicating a bullish sentiment for the day.

The close price is also below both the 50-day and 200-day SMAs, indicating a longer-term downward trend. The RSI is above 30, indicating that the stock is not oversold, but the low value suggests that the stock has been declining for some time.

Analysis**<br /><br />The last closing candle on 2024-06-26 has a bullish bias, with a higher close compared to the open and a higher high compared to the previous day. The stock has been trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating a positive trend. The RSI value of 59.72 suggests that the stock is not overbought, leaving room for further upside potential.<br /><br />However, the MACD histogram has been decreasing, indicating a potential bearish divergence. The STOCHastic oscillator is also showing a bearish crossover, which could suggest a short-term pullback.<br /><br />In summary, while the overall trend remains bullish, investors should be aware of potential short-term weakness. A pullback to the support level around the 50-day moving average could provide a buying opportunity for those looking to enter or add to their positions. However, stops should be set to limit potential losses if the stock breaks below this support level.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-25</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Trading Day:** 2024-06-25<br /><br />**Closing Price:** 855.510009765625<br /><br />**Analysis:**<br /><br />The closing price on 2024-06-25 is higher than the previous day's close, indicating a potential bullish sentiment.

Therefore, it may be a good time to consider bearish positions on this stock.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-25</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report**:**System**,<br /><br />**Closing Price Data:** 2024-06-25<br /><br />| **Metric**          | **Value**                                       |<br />|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|<br />| Date                | 2024-06-25                                       |<br />| Open                | 47.220001220703125                                |<br />| High                | 47.814998626708984                                |<br />| Low                 | 46.9900016784668                                  |<br />| Close               | **47.380001068115234**                             |<br />| Adj Close           | 47.380001068115234                                |<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| **Metric**          | **Value**                                       |<br />|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|<br />| Volume              | 14,487,305                                       |<br />| SMA_50             | 48.82816467285156                                |<br />| SMA_200            | 51.632350025177004                                |<br />| EMA_50             | 48.66732884273004                                |<br />| EMA_200            | 50.47052489432943                                |<br />| RSI_14             | **53.41984208922162**                             |<br />| MACD_12_26_12     | 0.09685535825051673                               |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12   | 0.6338854946336272                               |<br />| MACDs_12_26_12   | -0.02937393978959492                             |<br />| BBL_20_2.0        | 48.4647058562755                                |<br />| BBM_20_2.0        | 49.5006518373026                                |<br />| BBU_20_2.0        | 50.536597818329696                               |<br />| BBB_20_2.0        | 4.185585209794881                                |<br />| BBP_20_2.0        | 0.6300012864541573                               |<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3    | 0.6338854946336272                               |<br />| STOCHd_14_3_3    | 0.5341984208922162                               |<br />| ATRr_14            | 0.6285354333959277                               |<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />The closing price on 2024-06-25 is **47.380001068115234**.

This indicates a potential downtrend in the long term.<br />3. The exponential moving averages (EMA_50 and EMA_200) also show a bearish signal, as the close is below both of them (338.7913282326726).<br />4. The Relative Strength Index (RSI_14) is at 32.744415044784546, which is below the 30 threshold, indicating oversold conditions.<br />5. The MACD (MACD_12_26_12) is negative (-0.06458008731067366), and the MACD line (MACDs_12_26_12) is below the signal line (MACDh_12_26_12), suggesting a bearish momentum.<br />6.

The moving averages are in a bullish trend, but the RSI and MACD indicators are neutral, and the price action is sideways.

This suggests that the stock is not overbought or oversold at the moment. The MACD lines are not provided in the analysis report.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands show that the last closing price is near the lower band, suggesting that the stock may be oversold in the short term. However, the bandwidth is narrowing, indicating a decrease in volatility.<br /><br />In conclusion, the last closing candle does not provide a clear indication of whether to be bullish or bearish. The lower close price compared to the previous week may suggest a downtrend, but the close price is still above key moving averages. The RSI and MACD are close to the neutral zone, while the Bollinger Bands suggest a potential oversold condition in the short term. Therefore, a neutral stance may be appropriate until further price action confirms a clear trend.</td></tr><tr class='child-table MCD'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent MCD'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-05</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Technical Analysis Report**---------------<br /><br />**Price Data:** Last closing candle on 2024-07-05<br /><br />| **Metric** | **Value** |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| Open | 251.0 |<br />| High | 251.4199981689453 |<br />| Low | 248.80999755859375 |<br />| Close | 251.08999633789062 |<br /><br />**Candle Analysis:**<br /><br />The last closing candle is a bullish candle, as the closing price is higher than the opening price. The small real body indicates a lack of price movement during this time, while the higher close suggests a positive sentiment among traders. However, the long upper wick indicates resistance at higher prices, preventing the price from moving higher and resulting in a pullback. The short lower wick suggests little buying interest at lower prices.<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />The 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is 250.83, and the 200-day SMA is 248.51. The price is above both the 50-day and 200-day SMAs, indicating an uptrend.<br /><br />**Exponential Moving Averages:**<br /><br />The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is 251.33, and the 200-day EMA is 249.51.

The MACD line is above the signal line, indicating a neutral trend.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle suggests a slightly bullish sentiment, but with some resistance at higher prices. The overall trend is still bullish, with the price above both the 50-day and 200-day SMAs. However, traders should be cautious of the resistance at higher prices and monitor the stock for any signs of a reversal. It may be a good time to consider a neutral to slightly bullish stance, but with a close eye on the stock's performance.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-03</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** _250.0_<br /><br />**Open Price:** _248.5_<br /><br />**High Price:** _250.97999572753906_<br /><br />**Low Price:** _248.17999267578125_<br /><br />**Volume:** _2,026,100_<br /><br />The following analysis is based on the price data from the last closing candle on 2024-07-03.<br /><br />**Candle Analysis:**<br /><br />The last closing candle exhibited a bullish pattern, also known as a hammer, characterized by a small real body near the high of the candle, a long lower wick, and a short or nonexistent upper wick. This indicates that the market opened lower than the closing price, buyers stepped in and pushed the price up, but sellers managed to bring the price back down near the open price. The long lower wick signifies strong buying interest, and the closing price being above the open price is a positive sign.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):**<br /><br />The RSI for the last closing candle was 50.17, which is a neutral value, neither overbought nor oversold. This suggests that the market is currently in equilibrium between buyers and sellers.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />The MACD, which consists of the MACD line (12-day exponential moving average - 26-day exponential moving average) and the signal line (9-day exponential moving average of MACD), was relatively flat. The MACD line was at -0.04, and the signal line was at 0.01, indicating no clear short-term trend in the market.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands, consisting of a 20-day simple moving average and two standard deviation lines, showed that the last closing price was near the lower Bollinger Band. This suggests that the stock is currently oversold and may be due for a rebound.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle indicates a neutral to slightly bullish outlook. The hammer-like shape of the candle, along with the closing price being above the open price, suggests that buyers are present in the market. However, the relatively flat MACD and the oversold condition based on the Bollinger Bands suggest that the market may be in a state of equilibrium or consolidation. Traders and investors should consider these factors and other market conditions before making decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-02</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-02<br /><br />**Open:** *249.67999267578125*<br /><br />**High:** *251.02999877929688*<br /><br />**Low:** *247.41000366210938*<br /><br />**Close:** *247.7899932861328*<br /><br />The stock opened at 249.67999267578125, reached a high of 251.02999877929688, dipped to a low of 247.41000366210938, and closed at 247.7899932861328.<br /><br />**Trend Analysis:**<br /><br />* The closing price is lower than both the open and the previous day's close (254.8300018310547), indicating a bearish trend.<br />* The stock has been on a downtrend since April 3rd, with occasional rallies that were not sustained.<br /><br />**Moving Average Analysis:**<br /><br />* The 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is 253.123511328125.<br />* The 200-day SMA is 261.536005859375.<br />* The stock has recently fallen below both SMAs, which could indicate a shift in the short-term trend.<br /><br />**Technical Indicator Analysis:**<br /><br />* The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 25.41, significantly below the neutral level of 50, indicating oversold conditions.<br />* The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) lines are both negative, with the signal line crossing below the MACD line, further supporting the bearish outlook.<br /><br />**Volatility Analysis:**<br /><br />* The Bollinger Bands show that the last closing price is near the lower band, indicating that the stock is trading at the lower end of its recent volatility range.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle suggests a bearish trend, with the stock closing lower than both the open and the previous day's close.

However, investors should also consider other factors, such as the company's fundamentals and market conditions, before making a decision.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-26</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-06-26<br /><br />**Closing Price:** **\*\*\*\*257.8299865722656\*\*\*\***<br /><br />The stock closed at a price of 257.8299865722656, which is slightly lower than the opening price of 258.1700134277344, indicating a **\*\*\*slight decrease in price during the day\*\*\***.<br /><br />**High Price:** **\*\*\*258.67999267578125\*\*\***<br /><br />The high price of the day was 258.67999267578125.<br /><br />**Low Price:** **\*\*\*254.67999267578125\*\*\***<br /><br />The low price was 254.67999267578125.<br /><br />**Volume:** **\*\*\*2,552,372\*\*\***<br /><br />The stock's volume for the day was 2,552,372, which is **\*\*\*relatively low compared to some of the previous days in the dataset\*\*\** and could indicate decreased interest or lower trading activity in the stock.<br /><br />**50-day SMA:** **\*\*\*290.43059814453125\*\*\***<br /><br />The stock's 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is 290.43059814453125.<br /><br />**200-day SMA:** **\*\*\*283.27189880371094\*\*\***<br /><br />The stock's 200-day SMA is 283.27189880371094.<br /><br />**RSI:** **\*\*\*42.257706797251515\*\*\***<br /><br />The stock's relative strength index (RSI) for the past 14 periods is 42.257706797251515, which is in **\*\*\*neutral territory\*\*\** (RSI values above 70 indicate that a stock may be overbought, while values below 30 suggest that a stock may be oversold).<br /><br />**MACD:**<br /><br />The stock's moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is negative, indicating that the **\*\*\*short-term trend is downward\*\*\**; however, the MACD lines are close together, suggesting that the downtrend may be **\*\*\*weakening\*\*\** (the MACD lines represent the difference between the 12-day and 26-day exponential moving averages, and the histogram shows the difference between the two signals).<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle does not provide a clear indication of whether to be bullish or bearish on the stock. The slightly lower closing price and low volume could suggest decreased interest in the stock, but the long-term moving averages and neutral RSI suggest that the stock may be undervalued. Investors should consider additional indicators and factors before making a decision.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-25</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td

indicates a bullish trend, with the last closing price higher than the opening price and above both 50-day and 200-day EMAs. The trading volume is within the normal range, as indicated by the volume value being slightly above the 50-day SMA and significantly below the 200-day SMA.<br /><br />The MACD and Stochastic Oscillator indicators support a bullish trend, with the MACD line above the signal line and the %K line above the %D line. However, the RSI and Bollinger Bands suggest that the stock may be overbought, as the RSI value is close to the neutral level of 50 but the last closing price is near the upper Bollinger Band. This indicates a potential for a correction in the near future.<br /><br />Therefore, it may be a good time to be cautiously bullish, as the overall trend is bullish but there may be short-term volatility due to the potential for a correction.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-26</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**__________________________________________<br /><br />**Closing Price** on 2024-06-26: 138.22999572753906<br /><br />**Opening Price** on 2024-06-26: 139.49000549316406<br /><br />The closing price of the stock represents a slight decrease from the opening price, indicating a downward trend in the last trading session.

This indicates a potential reversal in the trend, favoring the bears. The stock opened higher than the previous close but quickly dropped and closed below the previous day's open, which is a bearish sign. The volume for the last closing candle was slightly above the 50-day moving average volume (SMA_50) and significantly above the 200-day moving average volume (SMA_200). Increased volume during a bearish reversal can be a strong indication of a downward trend.<br /><br />The 50-day moving average is above the 200-day moving average, indicating an overall uptrend. However, the bearish engulfing candle and increased volume suggest a potential reversal. The RSI is close to 50, indicating a neutral momentum. However, the recent bearish engulfing candle suggests that the momentum may shift towards the bears. The MACD line is below the signal line, which is a bearish sign. The stock price is near the lower Bollinger Band, which is a bearish sign. The Stochastic %K line is below the Stochastic %D line, which is a bearish sign.<br /><br />In conclusion, the last closing candle indicates a bearish outlook due to the bearish engulfing candle, increased volume, and the stock price nearing the lower Bollinger Band. However, it is essential to consider other factors and indicators when making investment decisions.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr class='parent-row buy buy_daily' id='SAP'><td>SAP</td><td>SAP  SE ADS</td><td>2024-07-05</td><td>bullish</td></tr><tr class='explanation-table SAP'><td colspan='4'>**Technical Analysis Report******<br /><br />**Weekly Chart**<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-01<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| **Metric** | **Value** |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| Open | 200.5399932861328 |<br />| High | 206.0800018310547 |<br />| Low | 197.5500030517578 |<br />| Close | 205.94000244140625 |<br /><br />**Candle Analysis:**<br /><br />The last closing candle is a bullish candle, also known as a hammer or a hanging man.

Therefore, it's recommended to be cautiously optimistic and consider taking profits if the stock continues to rise in the short term.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr class='parent-row inconclusive sell_daily' id='SHEL'><td>SHEL</td><td>Shell PLC American Depositary Shares (each representing two (2) Ordinary Shares) </td><td>2024-07-05</td><td>neutral</td></tr><tr class='explanation-table SHEL'><td colspan='4'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-03<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 59.650001525878906<br /><br />**Adjusted Close Price:** 57.24980163574219<br /><br />**Open Price:** 61.2599983215332<br /><br />**High:** 61.310001373291016<br /><br />**Low:** 58.13999938964844<br /><br />**Volume:** 1,681,0189<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| **Indicator**          | **Value**                                 |<br />|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|<br />| 50-day SMA             | 55.84240020751953                         |<br />| 200-day SMA            | 46.810249996185306                         |<br />| 50-day EMA            | 54.32393855669755                         |<br />| 200-day EMA            | 50.879804426794784                         |<br />| 14-day RSI             | 0.6664001437907459                         |<br />| MACD 12-26-12 line    | -0.28657772117105174                     |<br />| MACD histogram        | 0.9529778649617976                         |<br />| Bollinger Bands (BBM)  | 62.1270752465725                         |<br />| Upper Band (BBU)       | 73.80026272431759                         |<br />| Lower Band (BBB)       | 50.453953976241046                         |<br />| Bollinger Band Width (BBW)| 21.34600019454956                         |<br />| Bollinger Band % (BBP)  | 0.894969904564921                         |<br />| 14-day STOCHk         | 0.6664001437907459                         |<br />| 14-day STOCHd         | 0.5306696396466681                         |<br />| 14-day ATRr           | 1.687143793478072                         |<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />The last closing candle does not indicate a clear bullish or bearish trend.

This price is above both the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of 68.8772 and the 200-day SMA of 70.9762, indicating a potential bullish trend. However, the price is below the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) of 73.94, suggesting some bearish pressure in the short term.<br /><br />**Moving Average Indicators:**<br /><br />The 50-day SMA is below the 200-day SMA, indicating a long-term bullish trend. However, the short-term trend is bearish as the closing price is below the 20-day EMA.<br /><br />**Oscillator Indicators:**<br /><br />The RSI is at 51.78, which is close to the neutral zone (50), indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. The MACD lines are positive, with the MACD line (12-day EMA - 26-day EMA) at 0.0565 and the signal line (9-day EMA of MACD) at 0.4612, which is a bullish sign.<br /><br />**Volatility Indicators:**<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands show that the closing price is near the upper band, suggesting that the stock might be overextended in the short term.

Investors should be cautious and consider taking profits if they have open long positions. Traders might consider short-term bearish strategies, such as selling call options or buying put options, while maintaining a long-term bullish outlook. However, it is essential to monitor the stock's price action and technical indicators closely, as the situation might change rapidly.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-03</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-03<br /><br />**Open Price:** 73.0<br /><br />**High:** 73.52999877929688<br /><br />**Low:** 72.94000244140625<br /><br />**Close Price:** 73.01000213623047<br /><br />**Trading Volume:** 157,0220<br /><br />**Average True Range (ATR):** 0.899498626811247<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 0.8290910784882896<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />* MACD Line: 1.4103486617800627<br />* Signal Line: 0.4477762451421834<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />* Closing Price: Near Upper Band<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:** 0.8530868824612139<br /><br />The last closing candle (2024-07-03) exhibited a minor decrease in price from the open to the close.

The open price was 174.24, and the high and low prices for the day were 175.30 and 170.45, respectively. This indicates that the stock opened slightly higher than the closing price, reached a high of 175.30 during the day, and dipped to a low of 170.45 before closing.<br /><br />**Moving Averages**<br /><br />The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is 154.97, and the 200-day SMA is 130.37. The stock has been in an overall uptrend, as the 50-day SMA is above the 200-day SMA. However, the 50-day SMA has been decreasing in recent days, indicating a potential slowdown in the uptrend.<br /><br />The exponential moving averages (EMAs) for 50 and 200 days are 154.93 and 130.04, respectively. The EMAs are also above the SMAs, and the 50-day EMA has been decreasing while the 200-day EMA has been increasing. This could suggest a potential bearish signal, as the short-term trend is downward while the long-term trend is upward.<br /><br />**Technical Indicators**<br /><br />The relative strength index (RSI) for the last closing candle is 49.52, which is close to the neutral threshold of 50. This suggests that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, and that the recent price action has been relatively stable.<br /><br />The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicators are also close to neutral, with the MACD line at -0.05 and the signal line at 0.01. This suggests that there is currently no strong momentum in the market, and that the stock may be due for a breakout in either direction.<br /><br />**Conclusion**<br /><br />Based on the analysis, it may be appropriate to adopt a neutral stance towards the stock. While the long-term trend has been upward, the recent downward trend in the 50-day SMA and EMA suggests that the stock may be due for a correction. However, the RSI and MACD indicators are close to neutral, suggesting that the market is currently in a state of equilibrium. Therefore, it may be best to wait for further price action before making a decision.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-28</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Report**____________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-06-28<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 173.80999755859375<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 172.80999755859375<br /><br />**High:** 176.82000732421875<br /><br />**Low:** 172.80999755859375<br /><br />**Volume:** 11203600<br /><br />**Adj.

The Stochastic Oscillator is also in oversold territory, but the fact that the %K line has crossed below the %D line suggests that the downtrend may continue in the near term.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />Based on the technical analysis of the last closing candle, the stock appears to be in a downtrend, with oversold conditions and bearish signals from various indicators.</td></tr><tr class='child-table UNH'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent UNH'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-05</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-05<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 488.010009765625<br /><br />**Open Price:** 489.0<br /><br />**High:** 489.6700134277344<br /><br />**Low:** 484.5<br /><br />**Volume:** 3498500<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| **Indicator**          | **Value**                                                 |<br />|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|<br />| 50-day SMA             | 493.4833850209221                                         |<br />| 200-day SMA            | 506.5014122539355                                         |<br />| RSI                    | 27.777309917847216                                         |<br />| MACD Line             | -10.744354152592052                                       |<br />| Signal Line            | -3.4631867482285505                                       |<br />| Bollinger Bands (Lower) | 481.3552338422636                                         |<br />| Bollinger Bands (Upper) | 515.7657852491836                                         |<br />| Stochastic Oscillator | 15.460163760184281                                       |<br />| ATR                   | 13.104416600250564                                         |<br /><br />**Analysis:**<br /><br />The last closing candle in the provided 90 days of price data occurred on 2024-07-05. The open price for this candle was 489.0, and the high and low prices were 489.6700134277344 and 484.5, respectively. The close price was 488.010009765625. This candle is considered bearish as the close price is lower than the open price.<br /><br />The volume for this candle was 3498500, which is above both the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of 493.4833850209221 and the 200-day SMA of 506.5014122539355. This indicates increased trading activity.<br /><br />The 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) is currently above the 200-day EMA, which is a bullish signal. However, the RSI is at 27.777309917847216, which is below 30, indicating oversold conditions. The MACD line is negative, with the MACD line (-10.744354152592052) below the signal line (-3.4631867482285505), which is a bearish signal.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands indicate that the close price is near the lower band, which may suggest a potential rebound. The Stochastic Oscillator is also below 20, indicating oversold conditions. The ATR is relatively high at 13.104416600250564, indicating high volatility.<br /><br />In conclusion, the last closing candle indicates bearish conditions due to the lower close compared to the open and the negative MACD. However, the oversold conditions indicated by the RSI and Stochastic Oscillator suggest a potential rebound. The high volume and the position of the close near the lower Bollinger Band also support this possibility. Therefore, it might be a good time for cautious bullish positions, but it is essential to monitor the market closely for any changes in trends.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-03</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-03<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 497.1199951171875<br /><br />**High:** 498.0799865722656<br /><br />**Low:** 486.5199890136719<br /><br />**Closing Price:** 489.8900146484375<br /><br />**Volume:** 2239200<br /><br />**Candle Analysis:**<br /><br />This candle represents a bearish trend, as the closing price of 489.8900146484375 is lower than the opening price of 497.1199951171875.<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** The RSI value for this candle is 10.5023865878414, which is a very low reading.

Observations**<br /><br />The last closing candle (2024-07-05) is a bullish engulfing pattern, which could indicate a potential reversal in the market trend. However, the price is near the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting that the stock might be oversold in the short term. The MACD line is above the signal line, but the MACD line is below the signal line, which could be a sign of a potential bearish reversal. The RSI and Stochastic Oscillator values are close to the neutral zone, indicating that the market is neither overbought nor oversold. The price has been above the 50-day SMA for an extended period, indicating an uptrend, and the 200-day SMA is still below the 50-day SMA, which is a positive sign for the bulls.<br /><br />In summary, the market seems to be in a consolidation phase, and it is essential to exercise caution due to the mixed signals from the technical indicators. A neutral to slightly bullish stance might be appropriate, considering the data provided.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-03</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>I.

The short-term and long-term moving averages (SMA_50 and SMA_200) suggest a bearish trend, as the close price is below both averages. The RSI_14 is slightly bullish, but the MACD, Stochastic Oscillator, and Bollinger Bands indicators suggest a bearish trend. The ATRr_14 is relatively low, indicating low volatility.<br /><br />Therefore, based on the provided analysis report, it may be a good time to be bearish or neutral, but not bullish.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-27</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report**:**2024-06-27 Trading Day Recap**<br /><br />**Open:** 68.29000091552734<br /><br />**High:** 68.58000183105469<br /><br />**Low:** 67.66999816894531<br /><br />**Close:** 67.87999725341797<br /><br />**Candle Type:** Bearish<br /><br />The most recent trading day, 2024-06-27, displayed a bearish candle on the daily chart.

However, the long-term trend remains bullish, and investors may want to consider buying opportunities if the stock price dips below the SMA_50 or SMA_200.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-02</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**<br /><br />**Candle Data:**<br /><br />| **Parameter** | **Value** |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| Open price | 115.9000015258789 |<br />| High price | 115.94000244140625 |<br />| Low price | 113.48999786376953 |<br />| Close price | 114.18000030517578 |<br />| Volume | 13,325,100 |<br /><br />The last closing candle exhibited a bearish trend, as the close price of 114.18000030517578 was lower than the previous day's close.
