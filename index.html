The Close price of 219.86 is above the SMA_50 (212.6) and SMA_200 (189.52), suggesting an uptrend. The EMA_50 (212.7) is also above the EMA_200 (192.5), supporting the bullish outlook.<br /><br />**Momentum Indicators**<br />-----------------------<br /><br />However, the RSI_14 is at 50.79, which is close to the neutral zone (50), indicating that the momentum might be weakening. The MACD indicators show a slight bearish divergence, with the MACD line (1.3) being above the signal line (-2.24), but the histogram is negative (-3.24), which might suggest a potential reversal.<br /><br />**Overbought and Oversold Conditions**<br />---------------------------------------<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands show that the Close price is near the upper band (220.74), and the BBP (24.58) is above the upper band, which could indicate an overbought condition. The STOCHastic indicators also show an overbought situation, with the STOCHk (22.67) above the STOCHd (20.53) and both above the 80 level.<br /><br />**Summary**<br />----------<br /><br />In summary, the last closing candle suggests a slightly bullish market, but there are signs of weakening momentum and potential reversal. The RSI_14 and MACD indicators suggest a potential reversal, while the Bollinger Bands and STOCHastic indicators indicate an overbought condition. Investors should be cautious and consider a 3:1 risk-reward ratio for potential entries.<br /><br />**Potential Entry Setup**<br />-------------------------<br /><br />A possible entry could be a sell order with an entry price of 220.00, a stop loss level of 225.00, and a take profit level of 205.00. This setup provides a risk-reward ratio of approximately 1:3, taking into account the ATRr_14 (5.42) for setting appropriate stop loss and take profit levels. However, traders should perform their own analysis and consider other factors before making any trading decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-08-01</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Data:** 2024-08-01<br /><br />**Price Data:**<br /><br />| **Metric**          | **Value** |<br />|---------------------|-----------|<br />| Open                | 224.37    |<br />| High                | 224.48    |<br />| Low                 | 217.02    |<br />| Close               | 218.36    |<br />| Adj Close           | 218.36    |<br />| Volume              | 61877900  |<br />| SMA_50             | 212.05    |<br />| SMA_200            | 189.32    |<br />| EMA_50             | 212.41    |<br />| EMA_200            | 192.23    |<br />| RSI_14             | 48.52     |<br />| MACD_12_26_12     | 1.51      |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12   | -2.44     |<br />| MACDs_12_26_12   | 3.95      |<br />| BBL_20_2.0        | 209.78    |<br />| BBM_20_2.0        | 220.83    |<br />| BBU_20_2.0        | 231.89    |<br />| BBB_20_2.0        | 10.01     |<br />| BBP_20_2.0        | 0.39      |<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3     | 22.5      |<br />| STOCHd_14_3_3     | 20.53     |<br />| ATRr_14            | 5.23      |<br /><br />**Analysis:**<br /><br />The last closing candle in the provided price data is for the date 2024-08-01. The price data for this candle is as follows:<br /><br />* Open: 224.37<br />* High: 224.48<br />* Low: 217.02<br />* Close: 218.36<br />* Adj Close: 218.36<br />* Volume: 61877900<br />* SMA_50: 212.05<br />* SMA_200: 189.32<br />* EMA_50: 212.41<br />* EMA_200: 192.23<br />* RSI_14: 48.52<br />* MACD_12_26_12: 1.51<br />* MACDh_12_26_12: -2.44<br />* MACDs_12_26_12: 3.95<br />* BBL_20_2.0: 209.78<br />* BBM_20_2.0: 220.83<br />* BBU_20_2.0: 231.89<br />* BBB_20_2.0: 10.01<br />* BBP_20_2.0: 0.39<br />* STOCHk_14_3_3: 22.5<br />* STOCHd_14_3_3: 20.53<br />* ATRr_14: 5.23<br /><br />Based on the provided data, the price opened at 224.37 and reached a high of 224.48, but then dropped throughout the day to close at 218.36. This represents a bearish signal, as the price closed lower than it opened. The volume for the day was also relatively high at 61877900, which may indicate increased selling pressure.<br /><br />The short-term moving averages (SMA_50 and EMA_50) are both above the price, which is another bearish signal. The long-term moving averages (SMA_200 and EMA_200) are both below the price, but they are still quite far away, so they are not providing a clear directional signal.<br /><br />The RSI_14 is at 48.52, which is in neutral territory and does not provide a clear directional signal. The MACD indicators are also mixed, with the MACD line (MACD_12_26_12) above the signal line (MACDh_12_26_12), but the histogram (MACDs_12_26_12) is negative, indicating a bearish trend.<br /><br />Overall, the last closing candle suggests that the market is in a downtrend, with the price closing lower than it opened and the short-term moving averages above the price. However, the long-term moving averages are still below the price, and the RSI and MACD indicators are mixed, so it may be worth waiting for further confirmation before making any trading decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-31</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Data:** 2024-07-31<br />----------------------------------<br /><br />**Price Data:**<br />---------------<br /><br />| **Metric** | **Value** |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| Open | 221.53 |<br />| High | 223.82 |<br />| Low | 220.64 |<br />| Close | 222.81 |<br />| Adj Close | 222.81 |<br />| Volume | 32575710 |<br /><br />**Comparison with Previous Candle:**<br />------------------------------------<br /><br />The last closing candle has a slightly higher open price and reached a high of 223.82, but closed slightly lower at 222.81.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI_14) is at 55.27, which is in the neutral zone, neither overbought nor oversold. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators show a positive MACD line, but the signal line is crossing below the MACD line, which could be a bearish signal. The Bollinger Bands (BBL_20_2.0, BBM_20_2.0, BBU_20_2.0, BBB_20_2.0, and BBP_20_2.0) show that the price is near the upper band, indicating that the price might correct downwards. The Stochastic indicators (STOCHk_14_3_3 and STOCHd_14_3_3) are in the overbought zone, suggesting that the price might correct downwards. The Average True Range (ATRr_14) indicator shows a high level of volatility.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br />--------------<br /><br />The last closing candle shows a slightly lower closing price compared to the high of the day, with lower volume.

This indicates a potential uptrend. The close is above both the SMA_50 and SMA_200, which are also trending upwards, providing further evidence of a potential uptrend. The RSI_14 is at 5.25, which is in the overbought region, indicating that the stock may be overvalued. However, this should be taken with a grain of salt as RSI values above 70 are not uncommon in strong uptrends.

A 3:1 risk reward ratio could be achieved by setting a stop loss at 182.29 (5% lower than the entry price) and a take profit at 209.29 (10% higher than the entry price). This would result in a risk of 4.64 and a potential reward of 19.99, meeting the 3:1 risk reward ratio.

The highest open price of 183.45 on the same day and the second highest high price of 186.85 on the previous day further support this trend. The highest low price of 182.17 on the last trading day also indicates that the stock has been consistently trading at high levels.<br /><br />The 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) and Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) are increasing, indicating a strong bullish trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for the last closing price is 72.04, which is above the overbought threshold of 70. This suggests that the stock may be overbought and due for a correction. However, the high RSI value also indicates that the stock has been consistently gaining momentum.<br /><br />The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) for the last closing price is 3.25, indicating a bullish trend. The MACD histogram is also positive, further confirming the bullish trend. The Bollinger Bands for the last closing price are 183.33 for the upper band, 163.79 for the lower band, and 173.58 for the middle band. The closing price is near the upper Bollinger Band, indicating that the stock is trading at the high end of its recent range.<br /><br />The Stochastic Oscillator for the last closing price is 90.06, which is above the overbought threshold of 80. This suggests that the stock is overbought and may be due for a correction. However, the high Stochastic Oscillator value also indicates that the stock has been consistently gaining momentum. The Average True Range (ATR) for the last closing price is 4.13, which is relatively high compared to the rest of the data range. This suggests that the stock has been experiencing high volatility.<br /><br />Investors and traders should exercise caution and consider these factors before making investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-25</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report (2024-07-25)**--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 182.17, **Increase from Previous Day:** 35.85 (24.5%)<br /><br />The **last closing candle** exhibited a bullish trend, with a significant price increase from the previous day's close of 146.32.

However, it is important to note that this is a hypothetical example and actual trade decisions should be based on a thorough analysis of the market conditions and the individual trader's risk tolerance.</td></tr><tr class='child-table ADI'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent ADI'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-08-02</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Data**<br />--------------------<br /><br />| **Date**          | **2024-08-02** |<br />|------------------|----------------|<br />| **Open**          | 212.48         |<br />| **High**          | 213.07         |<br />| **Low**           | 206.71         |<br />| **Close**         | 207.96         |<br />| **Adj Close**      | 207.96         |<br />| **Volume**        | 6796100        |<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Moving Averages**<br />-------------------<br /><br />| **SMA_50**        | 231.58         |<br />|------------------|----------------|<br />| **SMA_200**       | 200.21         |<br />| **EMA_50**        | 226.07         |<br />| **EMA_200**       | 206.39         |<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Technical Indicators**<br />------------------------<br /><br />| **RSI_14**        | 35.68          |<br />|------------------|----------------|<br />| **MACD_12_26_12**| -3.07          |<br />| **MACDh_12_26_12**| -2.87          |<br />| **MACDs_12_26_12**| -0.2           |<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands**<br />------------------<br /><br />| **BBL_20_2.0**   | 210.73         |<br />|------------------|----------------|<br />| **BBM_20_2.0**   | 227.36         |<br />| **BBU_20_2.0**   | 243.99         |<br />| **BBB_20_2.0**   | 14.63          |<br />| **BPP_20_2.0**   | -0.08          |<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator**<br />------------------------<br /><br />| **STOCHk_14_3_3**| 21.25          |<br />|------------------|----------------|<br />| **STOCHd_14_3_3**| 29.88          |<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Average True Range**<br />----------------------<br /><br />| **ATRr_14**       | 7.47           |<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Trend Analysis**<br />------------------<br /><br />The last closing candle indicates a bearish trend for the stock. The stock opened at 212.48 and quickly dropped to a low of 206.71 before closing at 207.96. The stock's close is significantly lower than its open, high, and even its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating strong bearish momentum.<br /><br />The stock's RSI is at 35.68, which is well below the 50-midline, indicating that the stock is oversold. The MACD histogram is also negative, indicating bearish momentum.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Trading Considerations**<br />-------------------------<br /><br />If you are considering entering a bearish position for this stock, you may want to wait for a confirmation of the downtrend. One way to do this is to wait for a break below the stock's recent low of 206.71. If the stock breaks below this level, it could indicate that the downtrend is continuing.<br /><br />Once you have identified a potential entry point, you can consider setting a stop loss to limit your potential losses. A stop loss is an order to sell a security when it reaches a certain price. For example, you could set a stop loss at 210.73, which is just above the stock's recent high. This would limit your potential losses if the stock reverses course and starts to rally.<br /><br />You can also consider setting a take profit level to lock in your profits. A take profit level is an order to sell a security when it reaches a certain price. For example, you could set a take profit level at 200.00, which is around the stock's 200-day moving average. This would allow you to lock in a profit of 7.96 per share if the stock reaches this level.<br /><br />It is important to note that trading involves risk, and it is essential to do your own research and consider seeking advice from a financial advisor before making any trading decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-08-01</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-08-01<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 218.92<br /><br />**Open Price:** 228.08<br /><br />**High:** 231.2<br /><br />**Low:** 216.77<br /><br />**SMA_50:** 231.75<br /><br />**SMA_200:** 200.04<br /><br />**EMA_50:** 226.81<br /><br />**EMA_200:** 206.37<br /><br />**RSI:** 41.75<br /><br />**MACD:** -1.58 (MACD line) / -1.91 (signal line)<br /><br />**Trend:** Bearish<br /><br />The last closing candle for the given date shows a bearish trend.

The volume for this candle is also lower than the previous day.<br /><br />The short-term moving averages (SMA_50 and EMA_50) are both above the price, indicating a downtrend in the short term. However, the long-term moving averages (SMA_200 and EMA_200) are both below the price, indicating an overall uptrend in the long term.<br /><br />The RSI is at 46.14, which is in neutral territory and does not indicate overbought or oversold conditions. The MACD is slightly negative, but not significantly, indicating a weak downtrend.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands are relatively wide, indicating high volatility. The price is currently near the lower Bollinger Band, which could indicate a buying opportunity. However, the STOCHastic oscillator is currently above 80, indicating overbought conditions, which could suggest caution for buyers.<br /><br />Overall, the last closing candle does not provide a clear signal for traders and investors. The short-term downtrend is not supported by the long-term uptrend, and the indicators are mixed.

The price has been in a downtrend for the past few weeks, with the close price being below both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages (SMA 50 and SMA 200). The RSI indicator is at 39.05, which is below the neutral level of 50, indicating that the stock is oversold. The MACD indicator is also bearish, with the MACD line (8.64) below the signal line (-5.67). The Bollinger Bands are also bearish, with the close price near the lower Bollinger Band (181.81).<br /><br />**Entry Strategy:**<br /><br />With a 3:1 risk reward ratio, a potential entry could be considered at a price level where the stop loss would limit risk to 1/3 of the potential profit. Given the current price of 181.81 and the recent low of 179.63, a stop loss level of 185 could be considered. This would give a potential profit of around 20 points (the distance between the current price and the upper Bollinger Band) and a risk of around 6-7 points. However, it's important to note that this is a rough estimate and actual stop loss levels should be determined based on individual risk tolerance and trading strategy.</td></tr><tr class='child-table AMAT'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent AMAT'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-08-02</td><td>slightly bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Technical Analysis Report**---------------<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-08-02<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 181.81<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| **Indicator** | **Value** |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| Open | 187.87 |<br />| High | 189.57 |<br />| Low | 179.63 |<br />| Close | 181.81 |<br />| Adj Close | 181.81 |<br />| Volume | 12989300 |<br />| SMA_50 | 226.31 |<br />| SMA_200 | 189.09 |<br />| EMA_50 | 219.94 |<br />| EMA_200 | 194.65 |<br />| RSI_14 | 31.98 |<br />| MACD_12_26_12 | -10.35 |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12 | -5.12 |<br />| MACDs_12_26_12 | -5.23 |<br />| BBL_20_2.0 | 172.12 |<br />| BBM_20_2.0 | 214.08 |<br />| BBU_20_2.0 | 256.05 |<br />| BBB_20_2.0 | 13.93 |<br />| BBP_20_2.0 | 14.0 |<br />| ATRr_14 | 10.56 |<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />The last closing candle indicates a bearish trend, as the close price is lower than the open price and both the EMA_50 and EMA_200 are declining.

The price data for this candle is as follows:<br /><br />* Open: 334.08<br />* High: 340.89<br />* Low: 325.73<br />* Close: 333.99<br />* Adj Close: 333.99<br />* Volume: 119,001,999<br />* SMA 50: 288.13<br />* SMA 200: 250.71<br />* EMA 50: 290.11<br />* EMA 200: 254.07<br />* RSI 14: 68.59<br />* MACD 12 26 12: 13.19<br />* MACDh 12 26 12: 3.77<br />* MACDs 12 26 12: 9.42<br />* BBL 20 2.0: 264.85<br />* BBM 20 2.0: 308.8<br />* BBU 20 2.0: 352.75<br />* BBB 20 2.0: 28.46<br />* BBP 20 2.0: 2.79<br />* STOCHk 14 3 3: 86.29<br />* STOCHd 14 3 3: 88.1<br />* ATRr 14: 15.24<br /><br />The last closing candle is near the upper end of the range for the week, with a close of 333.99. This is higher than the SMA 50 (288.13) and the SMA 200 (250.71), indicating an upward trend. The EMA 50 (290.11) is also higher than the EMA 200 (254.07), supporting this trend.<br /><br />The RSI 14 is 68.59, which is above the neutral midpoint of 50, indicating that the stock is overbought. However, this is not necessarily a bearish sign, as overbought conditions can persist in strong uptrends.<br /><br />The MACD histogram (MACDh 12 26 12) is positive at 3.77, indicating that the short-term trend is rising faster than the long-term trend. The MACD signal line (MACDs 12 26 12) is also positive at 9.42, supporting this trend.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands show that the price is near the upper Bollinger Band (BBU 20 2.0 at 352.75), indicating that the price is high relative to its recent range. However, the price has touched the upper Bollinger Band several times in the past few weeks, so this is not necessarily a bearish sign.<br /><br />The Stochastic Oscillator (STOCHk 14 3 3) is at 86.29, which is above the neutral midpoint of 50, indicating that the stock is overbought. However, the Stochastic Oscillator (STOCHd 14 3 3) is at 88.1, which is above the STOCHk, indicating that the stock is even more overbought. This could be a bearish sign, as overbought conditions that persist for too long can eventually lead to a correction.<br /><br />The ATR (Average True Range) is 15.24, which is relatively high, indicating that the stock has been experiencing high volatility.<br /><br />Based on this analysis, the last closing candle suggests that the stock is in an uptrend, with the price near the upper end of its recent range. However, the stock is overbought, which could be a bearish sign. Investors and traders should exercise caution and consider taking profits if they have open long positions.<br /><br />**Entry and Exit Strategy:**<br /><br />As for a possible entry, given a 3:1 risk reward ratio, we would need to determine a stop loss level and a take profit level. One possible approach would be to set a stop loss level below the lower Bollinger Band (BBB 20 2.0 at 28.46) and a take profit level above the upper Bollinger Band (BBU 20 2.0 at 352.75). However, this approach would require a significant amount of risk, as the distance between the stop loss level and the entry price would be quite large.<br /><br />Another possible approach would be to set a stop loss level below the recent low of 325.73 and a take profit level above the recent high of 340.89. This approach would involve less risk, but the potential reward would also be smaller.<br /><br />Ultimately, the decision to enter a trade should be based on a careful analysis of the price data and an assessment of the investor's or trader's risk tolerance and investment goals.</td></tr><tr class='child-table AMGN'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent AMGN'><th>Daily

/>The last closing candle indicates a bearish signal as the close price is lower than the open price. The high price of the candle is significantly higher than the open price, suggesting strong resistance at higher price levels. Conversely, the low price is lower than the open price, indicating strong support at lower price levels.<br /><br />The technical indicators provide additional insights into the stock's current market position. The SMA and EMA indicators suggest that the stock is currently trading above both the 50 and 200-day moving averages, which is typically a bullish signal. However, the RSI indicator is above 70, indicating that the stock is overbought and may be due for a correction. The MACD indicators suggest that the stock is currently in a bullish trend, but the histogram is starting to flatten, indicating that the trend may be losing momentum. The Bollinger Bands suggest that the stock is currently trading near the upper band, indicating that it may be overextended. The Stochastic indicators also suggest that the stock is currently overbought, which is in line with the RSI indicator.<br /><br />In conclusion, the last closing candle suggests that the stock may be due for a correction, as it is currently overbought and trading near the upper Bollinger Band. However, the long-term trend is still bullish, as the stock is trading above both the 50 and 200-day moving averages. Therefore, it may be a good time to be cautiously bullish, but it is important to monitor the stock closely for any signs of a trend reversal.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-31</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report**:***<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle:** 2024-07-31<br /><br />**Candle Statistics:**<br /><br />* Open: 331.55<br />* High: 336.4<br />* Low: 330.57<br />* Close: 332.47<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* 50-day SMA: 315.5<br />* 200-day SMA: 291.33<br />* 50-day EMA: 315.5<br />* 200-day EMA: 291.33<br /><br />**Close Relative to Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* Close is below both the 50-day SMA and 200-day SMA<br />* Close is below both the 50-day EMA and 200-day EMA<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** RSI for the last closing candle is 61.91, which is in the neutral zone (between 30 and 70).<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** MACD for the last closing candle is 5.97, which is a bullish signal.

The close price is lower than the previous week's close and the low price is lower than the previous week's low. The open price is also lower than the previous week's open. The long wick on the candle indicates significant buying pressure during the week, but sellers managed to push the price down by the end.<br /><br />The RSI 14 is below 50, indicating a downtrend.

The BBB 20 2.0 is also below the close price, indicating a downtrend.<br /><br />**Trading Recommendation:**<br /><br />Based on the analysis, the last closing candle suggests a bearish outlook for the stock. Investors and traders may want to consider shorting the stock or waiting for a further pullback before entering a long position.<br /><br />**Hypothetical Entry, Stop Loss, and Take Profit Levels:**<br /><br />With a 3:1 risk reward ratio, a potential entry could be a short position at the close price of 113.45. A stop loss could be placed above the BBU 20 2.0 level of 188.57, providing a risk of approximately 75.12. To achieve a 3:1 risk reward ratio, the take profit level would need to be set at 231.68, which is 3 times the risk of 75.12.<br /><br />However, it's important to note that this is only a hypothetical example and actual entry, stop loss, and take profit levels should be determined based on a variety of factors, including market conditions, risk tolerance, and individual trading strategies.</td></tr><tr class='child-table ARM'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent ARM'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-08-02</td><td>slightly bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Data**<br />--------------------<br /><br />The last closing candle's date is **2024-08-02**.

The closing price is below major moving averages, including the 50-week simple moving average (SMA_50) and the 200-week simple moving average (SMA_200). Additionally, the closing price is below the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA_50) and the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA_200).<br /><br />The 14-period Relative Strength Index (RSI_14) is below 50, indicating a downtrend. The low RSI value also suggests that the security may be oversold, but a reversal is not necessarily imminent.<br /><br />The MACD line (-27.22) is below the signal line (50.09), indicating a bearish signal. The Bollinger Band Lower value (BBL_20_2.0) is at 800.95, indicating a strong downward move, while the Bollinger Band Middle value (BBM_20_2.0) is above the closing price, suggesting that the security is trading near the lower end of its recent range. The Bollinger Band Upper value (BBU_20_2.0) is significantly above the closing price, indicating a wide trading range and a strong downtrend.<br /><br />The Average True Range (ATRr_14) is relatively high at 76.66, suggesting increased volatility in the security's price action.<br /><br />**Potential Entry:**<br /><br />Considering a 3:1 risk-reward ratio, a potential short entry could be considered if the price shows signs of a bearish reversal pattern or breaks below the recent support level. Assuming a conservative stop loss above the Bollinger Band Upper value (1081.07) and targeting a 3% move, the entry price would be around 1050.00, the stop loss level would be 1084.07, and the take profit level would be 1020.60. This setup offers a potential reward of 3.07% with a risk of 3.37%, aligning with the desired 3:1 risk-reward ratio.<br /><br />Please note that this potential entry is for illustrative purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

Based solely on the technical analysis of the last closing candle, it may be advisable to wait for a more bullish signal before entering a long position. If considering a short position, a stop loss level could be placed above the upper Bollinger Band at 42.32, with a take profit level at a 3:1 risk-reward ratio, which would be around 37.44.

However, the EMA_50 has crossed above the EMA_200, which is a bullish signal.<br /><br />**RSI:** The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for the last candle is at 50.71, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.<br /><br />**MACD:** The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) lines are -0.45 and -0.21, with the signal line at -0.45. This suggests a bearish bias, but the MACD lines are close to crossing above the signal line, which would be a bullish signal.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:** The stock is trading near the lower band, indicating that it is undervalued. The BBW_20_2.0 is at 5.0, the BBM_20_2.0 is at 197.79, and the BBU_20_2.0 is at 202.74. The BBW_20_2.0 is above the BBM_20_2.0, indicating that the stock is oversold and due for a rebound.<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:** The %K line is at 22.8 and the %D line is at 22.8. This is a bearish signal, but the %K line is close to crossing above the %D line, which would be a bullish signal.<br /><br />**ATR:** The Average True Range (ATR)r_14 is at 3.53, indicating that the stock has low volatility. This is a positive sign for a potential trend reversal.<br /><br />**Conclusion:** The last closing candle shows a bullish reversal pattern, but the stock is trading below both the short-term and long-term moving averages. The MACD and Stochastic Oscillator are bearish, but the Bollinger Bands and ATR suggest that the stock is oversold and due for a rebound. Therefore, it may be a good time to be bullish, but it is important to exercise caution and wait for confirmation of a trend reversal before entering a trade.<br /><br />**Potential Entry:** If there is a possible entry, the entry price could be around the current price of 199.83, with a stop loss at 194.83 (below the recent low and the lower Bollinger Band) and a take profit level at 209.83 (above the recent high and the upper Bollinger Band). This would give a risk-reward ratio of 1:3, which is favorable for a trade. However, it is important to note that this is only a hypothetical example and actual trading decisions should be based on a thorough analysis of the market conditions and the trader's risk tolerance.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-08-01</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**__________________________________________<br /><br />**Date Range:** 2024-05-03 to 2024-08-01<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 196.31<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 194.21<br /><br />**Intraday Increase:** 1.05 points (0.54%)<br /><br />**High and Low:** 197.81 and 194.04, respectively<br /><br />**Closing Price Near High:** Indicates strong bullish sentiment<br /><br />**50-day SMA (SMA_50):** 199.21<br /><br />**200-day SMA (SMA_200):** 208.47<br /><br />**50-day SMA Below 200-day SMA:** Potential downtrend<br /><br />**Closing Price Above 50-day SMA:** Bullish sign<br /><br />**50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA):**<br /><br />EMA_50: 199.21<br /><br />EMA_200: 208.47<br /><br />**EMA_50 Below EMA_200:** Aligns with potential downtrend<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI_14):** 46.36<br /><br />**RSI_14 Close to Neutral Zone:** Asset neither overbought nor oversold<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />MACD_12_26_12: -0.43<br /><br />MACDh_12_26_12: 0.06<br /><br />MACDs_12_26_12: -0.49<br /><br />**MACD Lines Below Signal Line:** Bearish outlook<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands (BB):**<br /><br />BBU_20_2.0: 202.42<br /><br />BBM_20_2.0: 196.31<br /><br />BBL_20_2.0: 190.19<br /><br />**Price Near Lower Bollinger Band:** Potential reversion to the mean<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator (STOCH):**<br /><br />STOCHk_14_3_3: 0.37<br /><br />STOCHd_14_3_3: 0.09<br /><br />**STOCH Lines in Lower Part of Range:** Asset is oversold<br /><br />**Average True Range (ATR):** 4.9<br /><br />**ATR Indicates:** Moderate volatility<br /><br />**Summary:**<br /><br />The last closing candle shows a bullish intraday performance, but the long-term trends (SMA, EMA, and MACD) suggest a potential downtrend.

However, based on the current data, there is no clear reversal point, and the trend is strongly bearish. Therefore, it may not be advisable to enter a long position at this time. However, if the price shows signs of a reversal, a potential entry point could be above the recent high of 255.42, with a stop loss below the recent low of 199.38 and a take profit level at a distance that provides a 3:1 risk reward ratio. However, this would require careful monitoring of the price action and technical indicators.</td></tr><tr class='child-table COIN'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent COIN'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-08-02</td><td>slightly bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-08-02<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 204.44<br /><br />**Open Price:** 213.12<br /><br />**High:** 219.3<br /><br />**Low:** 199.38<br /><br />**Adjusted Close:** 204.44<br /><br />**Volume:** 10,018,100<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />| **Name**          | **Value** |<br />|-------------------|-----------|<br />| SMA_50            | 234.31    |<br />| SMA_200          | 185.49    |<br />| EMA_50           | 230.88    |<br />| EMA_200          | 191.56    |<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| **Name**          | **Value** |<br />|-------------------|-----------|<br />| RSI_14           | 38.09     |<br />| MACD_12_26_12   | -3.37     |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12  | -4.52     |<br />| MACDs_12_26_12  | 1.15      |<br />| BBL_20_2.0       | 197.37    |<br />| BBM_20_2.0       | 230.96    |<br />| BBU_20_2.0       | 264.55    |<br />| BBB_20_2.0       | 29.09     |<br />| BBP_20_2.0       | 0.11      |<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3    | 10.42     |<br />| STOCHd_14_3_3    | 16.04     |<br />| ATRr_14           | 16.29     |<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Technical Analysis:**<br /><br />The last closing candle indicates that the stock may be oversold, as the RSI_14 is below the neutral level of 50.

However, if a trader were to enter a long position at the current price of 217.89, a potential stop loss level could be below the recent low of 211.14.

However, the oversold conditions indicated by the oscillators may suggest a potential rebound. A neutral to slightly bearish stance may be appropriate. It is important to have a solid risk management strategy in place before entering any positions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-08-01</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report**_________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-08-01<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 48.62<br /><br />**Closing Price:** 47.39<br /><br />**Highest Price:** 48.72<br /><br />**Lowest Price:** 47.1 (Minimum: 45.87)<br /><br />**Volume:** 18,772,500<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* **Simple Moving Average (SMA):**<br />  * SMA_50: 48.64<br />  * SMA_200: 49.02<br />* **Exponential Moving Average (EMA):**<br />  * EMA_50: 48.93<br />  * EMA_200: 49.0<br />* **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 50.73<br />* **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br />  * MACD Line: 0.17<br />  * Signal Line: 0.09<br />* **Bollinger Bands:** Lower Band: 47.28<br />* **Average True Range (ATR):** 0.82<br /><br />**Technical Analysis:**<br /><br />The closing price on 2024-08-01 (47.39) is lower than the opening price (48.62), indicating a potential bearish trend.

Long-term investors could potentially accumulate positions at a lower price, provided that fundamental analysis supports the investment.<br /><br />**Entry Example:** A short position could be considered at the last closing price of 89.57 with a stop loss at the recent high of 92.2 and a take profit level at 3x the risk (e.g., 89.57 - 92.2 = -2.65, so take profit level would be 89.57 - 2.65 \* 3 = 76.88). This is a hypothetical example and should not be considered as financial advice. Always do your own research and consider your own risk tolerance when trading.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-08-01</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Data:** 2024-08-01<br />-----------------------------------<br /><br />**Price:**<br /><br />* Open: 93.86<br />* High: 93.95<br />* Low: 92.6<br />* Close: 93.05<br />* Adjusted Close: 93.05<br /><br />**Volume:** 9253300<br />------------------<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* SMA_50: 98.74<br />* SMA_200: 100.35<br /><br />**Exponential Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* EMA_50: 98.49<br />* EMA_200: 100.55<br /><br />**RSI (Relative Strength Index):** RSI_14 = 39.81 (Neutral)<br />---------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />* MACD_12_26_12: -2.13<br />* MACDh_12_26_12: 0.06<br />* MACDs_12_26_12: -2.19<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />* BBL_20_2.0: 88.74<br />* BBM_20_2.0: 94.61<br />* BBU_20_2.0: 100.47<br /><br />**Bollinger Band Percentages:**<br /><br />* BBB_20_2.0: 12.39<br />* BBP_20_2.0: 0.37<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:**<br /><br />* STOCHk_14_3_3: 45.22<br />* STOCHd_14_3_3: 38.7<br /><br />**Average True Range (ATR):** ATRr_14 = 1.73<br />-----------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Conclusion:** The last closing candle does not provide a clear indication of whether it is a good time to be bullish, bearish, or neutral on this stock.

A neutral stance may be appropriate until there is more clarity in the trend. The short-term trend may be slightly downward, but the long-term trend is still slightly upward. There are some indications of upward momentum and increased volatility, but the stochastic oscillator suggests that the stock may be oversold in the short-term.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-25</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**__________________________________________<br /><br />**Closing Price:** 769.31 (2024-07-25)<br /><br />**Open Price:** 797.3<br /><br />**High Price:** 801.74<br /><br />**Low Price:** 767.63<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* **SMA_50:** 775.86<br />* **SMA_200:** 790.05<br />* **EMA_50:** 779.01<br />* **EMA_200:** 789.83<br />* **RSI_14:** 34.43<br />* **MACD:** Bearish<br />* **BBL_20_2.0:** 740.28<br />* **STOCHk_14_3_3:** 20.16<br />* **ATRr_14:** 17.1<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />* The closing price is below both the SMA_50 and SMA_200, indicating a bearish trend.<br />* The EMA_50 and EMA_200 also show the closing price below their respective levels, further supporting the bearish trend.<br />* The RSI_14 is below 50, indicating a downtrend.<br />* The MACD line is below the signal line, and both lines are negative, suggesting a bearish trend.<br />* The BBL_20_2.0 is below the closing price, indicating oversold conditions.<br />* The STOCHk_14_3_3 is below 50, indicating a downtrend.<br />* The ATRr_14 is high, indicating increased volatility.<br /><br />**Conclusion:** Based on the provided technical indicators, the current trend appears to be bearish.

However, the low volatility and low volume may suggest a potential oversold condition, which could present a buying opportunity for traders with a high risk tolerance.<br /><br />For a trader looking for a potential entry point with a 3:1 risk reward ratio, a buy stop order above the upper Bollinger Band at 115.51 could be considered, with a stop loss at 108.2 (the low of the last candle) and a take profit level at 143.33 (3 times the distance from the entry to the stop loss).

The close price is below the Simple Moving Averages (SMA) of 50 and 200 days, as well as the Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) of 50 and 200 days. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is below 50, indicating that the stock is oversold.

This bearish signal is indicated by the market opening at a higher price and closing at a lower price.<br /><br />The volume for the last closing candle was _6,344,359_, which was slightly above the average volume of the past few days. This increase in volume suggests that there was significant selling pressure in the market.<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />The Simple Moving Averages (SMA) for the last closing candle were _50-day SMA: 68.52_ and _200-day SMA: 73.5_. The Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) were _50-day EMA: 70.35_ and _200-day EMA: 72.11_. The fact that the close price was below both the SMA_50 and EMA_50, as well as the SMA_200 and EMA_200, is a bearish indicator.<br /><br />**RSI and MACD:**<br /><br />The Relative Strength Index (RSI_14) for the last closing candle was _2.47_, which is below the oversold level of _30_. This indicates that the stock is oversold and may be due for a rebound. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators _MACD_12_26_12, MACDh_12_26_12, and MACDs_12_26_12_ were all negative, suggesting a bearish trend.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands Lower Band (BBL_20_2.0), Middle Band (BBM_20_2.0), Upper Band (BBU_20_2.0), and Bandwidth (BBB_20_2.0) were all negative, indicating a bearish trend.<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:**<br /><br />The Stochastic Oscillator %K (STOCHk_14_3_3) and %D (STOCHd_14_3_3) were also negative, suggesting a bearish trend.<br /><br />**Average True Range:**<br /><br />The Average True Range (ATRr_14) for the last closing candle was _1.87_, which is relatively high compared to the past few days. This indicates that the market is experiencing high volatility, which can be a risky proposition for investors.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle displayed a bearish trend, indicating a potential downward trend in the market. However, the oversold RSI_14 suggests that the stock may be due for a rebound. Investors should exercise caution and consider their risk tolerance before making any investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-30</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report******<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle:** 2024-07-30, $78.05<br /><br />**Price Movements:** Open: $77.42, High: $78.45, Low: $76.62<br /><br />The last closing candle showed a slight decrease in opening price compared to the previous day, but the stock price rose to a new high for the period before closing higher than the previous day's closing price.<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* SMA_50: $68.35<br />* SMA_200: $73.5<br />* EMA_50: $70.12<br />* EMA_200: $72.07<br /><br />Both the short-term (SMA_50) and long-term (SMA_200) trends are bullish, as both moving averages are below the closing price.

However, given the mixed signals, it may be advisable to wait for a clearer trend to emerge before entering any positions.</td></tr><tr class='child-table HON'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent HON'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-08-02</td><td>slightly bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**<br /><br />**Date of Last Closing Candle:** 2024-08-02<br /><br />**Detailed Analysis of the Last Closing Candle:**<br /><br />| **Metric** | **Value** |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| Open | 208.25 |<br />| High | 208.96 |<br />| Low | 201.3 |<br />| Close | 201.30 |<br /><br />The stock market analysis for the date 2024-08-02 is as follows:<br /><br />* The opening price of the stock was 208.25.<br />* The highest price recorded during the trading session was 208.96.<br />* The lowest price of the day was 201.3.<br />* The closing price of the stock was 201.30.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-08-01</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-08-01<br /><br />**Open:** 204.33<br />**High:** 206.76<br />**Low:** 201.50<br />**Close:** 204.58<br />**Adj Close:** 204.58<br />**Volume:** 3,726,400<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* **50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA_50):** 209.63<br />* **200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA_200):** 199.93<br />* **50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA_50):** 208.82<br />* **200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA_200):** 202.10<br />* **Relative Strength Index (RSI_14):** 39.67<br />* **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD_12_26_12):** -1.98<br />* **MACD Signal Line (MACDh_12_26_12):** -2.03<br />* **MACD Histogram (MACDs_12_26_12):** 0.05<br />* **Bollinger Bands (BB):**<br />	+ **Bollinger Band Upper (BBU_20_2.0):** 221.52<br />	+ **Bollinger Band Middle (BBM_20_2.0):** 209.47<br />	+ **Bollinger Band Lower (BBL_20_2.0):** 197.41<br />* **Stochastic Oscillator (STOCHk_14_3_3):** 39.92<br />* **Stochastic Oscillator Percentage D (STOCHd_14_3_3):** 20.80<br />* **Average True Range (ATRr_14):** 4.41<br /><br />**Summary:**<br /><br />The last closing candle indicates that the stock price closed at 204.58, which is slightly higher than the opening price of 204.33.

The open price of 31.42 was higher than the close price of 31.35 in the previous week, but the high price of 31.47 was only slightly higher than the open price. This limited upward movement is indicated by the small difference between the open and high prices.<br /><br />The low price of 20.42 represents a significant drop from the previous week's low of 30.95, indicating a decrease of approximately 34%. This bearish price action is indicated by the long lower wick on the candlestick chart, which shows that buyers were active at lower price levels.<br /><br />The close price of 21.48 is also a considerable decrease from the previous week's close of 31.35, representing a decrease of approximately 31%.

A cautiously bullish approach with a focus on risk management is recommended.<br /><br />**Entry Strategy:**<br /><br />If an entry is considered, a buy order could be placed below the low of the last closing candle, with a stop loss below the lower Bollinger Band. The take profit level could be set at the upper Bollinger Band or at a resistance level. However, it is essential to note that the market can be unpredictable, and there is always a risk of further downside.

However, it is important to note that actual entry, stop loss, and take profit levels should be determined based on the individual's risk tolerance and trading strategy.</td></tr><tr class='child-table LIN'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent LIN'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-08-02</td><td>slightly bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**__________________________<br /><br />**Date of Last Closing:** 2024-08-02<br /><br />**Candle Details:**<br /><br />| **Metric**          | **Value** |<br />|---------------------|-----------|<br />| Open                 | 449.61    |<br />| High                 | 457.79    |<br />| Low                  | 443.71    |<br />| Close                | 454.0     |<br />| Adjusted Close       | 454.0     |<br />| Volume              | 2714600   |<br />| SMA_50              | 439.22    |<br />| SMA_200             | 427.34    |<br />| EMA_50              | 442.12    |<br />| EMA_200             | 425.5     |<br />| RSI_14              | 64.36     |<br />| MACD_12_26_12      | 4.1       |<br />| MACDh_12_26_1      | -1.8      |<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA_50): 439.22<br />* 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA_200): 427.34<br /><br />**Exponential Moving Averages (EMA):**<br /><br />* 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA_50): 442.12<br />* 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA_200): 425.5<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* Relative Strength Index (RSI_14): 64.36<br />* Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): 4.1<br />* MACD Histogram: -1.8<br /><br />The above report is a factual and detailed analysis of the stock market data provided in the draft analysis.

However, it is important to note that technical analysis is not a guarantee of future performance, and other factors such as fundamental analysis and market sentiment should also be taken into account when making investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-30</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Data:** 2024-07-30<br />----------------------------------<br /><br />| **Metric**          | **Value** |<br />|---------------------|-----------|<br />| Open Price          | 815.18    |<br />| High                | 821.9     |<br />| Low                 | 775.81    |<br />| Close               | 790.21    |<br /><br />**Bearish Candle:**<br />------------------<br /><br />The last closing candle is a bearish candle, as the closing price is lower than the opening price, indicating that selling pressure was stronger than buying pressure during this period.<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br />------------------------<br /><br />| **Indicator**          | **Value**                 |<br />|-----------------------|---------------------------|<br />| SMA_50                | 865.36                    |<br />| SMA_200              | 723.8                     |<br />| EMA_50               | 864.98                    |<br />| EMA_200              | 722.88                    |<br />| RSI_14               | 29.53                     |<br />| MACD_12_26_12       | -28.68                    |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12      | -20.05                    |<br />| MACDs_12_26_12      | -8.63                     |<br />| BBL_20_2.0          | N/A                       |<br />| BBM_20_2.0          | N/A                       |<br />| BBU_20_2.0          | N/A                       |<br />| BBB_20_2.0          | N/A                       |<br />| BBP_20_2.0          | N/A                       |<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3       | 1.13                      |<br />| STOCHd_14_3_3       | 0.14                      |<br />| ATRr_14              | 26.72                     |<br /><br />**Technical Analysis:**<br />-----------------------<br /><br />* The 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA_50 and SMA_200) are above and below the last closing price, respectively.

However, the fact that the price is below the SMA 200 and EMA 200 is a bearish sign. The RSI 14 indicates that the stock is oversold, which could be a potential buying opportunity. The high volatility indicated by the ATRr 14 should be taken into consideration.<br /><br />**Potential Entry:**<br /><br />Based on this analysis, there is a potential entry for a long position. With a 3:1 risk reward ratio, the entry price would be 450.32, the stop loss level would be 435.42, and the take profit level would be 485.58.

The volume for this candle is also significantly higher than previous candles, indicating strong selling pressure.<br /><br />The RSI_14 is at 26.18, which is well below the oversold threshold of 30, indicating that the market is deeply oversold. The MACD indicators are also strongly negative, with the MACD line crossing below the signal line, indicating a bearish trend.<br /><br />Therefore, the current market conditions suggest a bearish trend. However, it is important to note that the market may be oversold and due for a correction, so traders should be cautious and use appropriate risk management strategies.<br /><br />**Potential Trade**<br />-------------------<br /><br />A potential short entry could be considered at the current price of 213.67 with a stop loss at 217.00 (just above the recent high) and a take profit level at 200.00 (a 10% decrease from the entry price).

The RSI value of 78.12 is above the overbought threshold of 70, while the MACD is above the signal line and the histogram is positive. The stock is currently trading near the upper Bollinger Band, which is a bullish sign. The ATR value of 2.71 indicates a moderate level of volatility.<br /><br />It's important to note that overbought conditions can sometimes lead to a pullback, so it may be wise to wait for a confirmation of the trend before entering a long position.

A stop loss could be placed just below the lower Bollinger Band and the 200-week SMA at 64.16, while a take profit level could be set at 76.37, which would give a 3:1 risk reward ratio.<br /><br />**Disclaimer:** Past performance is not indicative of future results, and investing in the stock market always carries a certain level of risk.

The price data for this candle is presented above. The price has broken above the SMA 50 and SMA 200, which were previously acting as resistance levels, indicating a potential trend reversal. The RSI is above 50, indicating a bullish trend. However, the MACD histogram is negative, which could indicate weakening bullish momentum.<br /><br />Additionally, the BBU 20 2.0 level has been broken, which could be a sign of a strong bullish trend. However, the BBP 20 2.0 level is close to the current price, which could act as a resistance level in the short term.<br /><br />**Entry:**<br /><br />A potential entry point for a long position could be around the current price of 488.14, with a stop loss level below the recent low of 456.7 and a take profit level at the recent high of 527.17. This would give a risk-reward ratio of approximately 1:3.<br /><br />However, it is important to note that this is only a potential entry point, and traders should always conduct their own analysis and risk management before entering any trade. Additionally, market conditions can change rapidly, and traders should be prepared to adjust their strategies as needed.</td></tr><tr class='child-table META'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent META'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-08-02</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report (2024-08-02)***<br /><br />**Candle Structure:** The last closing candle was bullish with a higher close compared to the open, forming a long white candle. The opening price was 489.0, and the closing price was 488.14, representing a slight decrease from the opening price.<br /><br />**Volume:** The trading volume on this day was significantly higher than the previous day, indicating increased investor interest and activity.<br /><br />**Moving Averages:** The SMA_50 (50-day Simple Moving Average) was above the SMA_200 (200-day Simple Moving Average), suggesting an uptrend. The EMA_50 (50-day Exponential Moving Average) was also above the EMA_200, supporting the uptrend.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** The RSI was at 50.42, which is considered a neutral level.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** The MACD line (12-26-9) crossed above the signal line (9-day EMA of the MACD line), indicating a bullish trend.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:** The price was trading near the upper band, indicating that the stock was near the high end of its recent price range.<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:** Based on the analysis of the provided technical indicators, the bullish candle structure and the confirmation from the moving averages and MACD suggest a bullish outlook for the stock. However, it is important to note that technical analysis is not a guarantee of future performance and should be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis.<br /><br />**Entry Strategy:** With a 3:1 risk reward ratio, a potential entry level could be identified by setting a stop loss below the recent low of the uptrend and a take profit level at a distance equal to three times the risk. For example, if the entry price is 488.14, a stop loss could be set at 470 (a 6% risk), and a take profit level could be set at 558.34 (a 14% gain). This would result in a potential risk reward ratio of 1:4.3.<br /><br />**Conclusion:** Given the bullish candle structure, increased trading volume, and confirmation from the moving averages and MACD, a potential entry could be considered with a stop loss below the recent low and a take profit level at a distance equal to three times the risk. However, it may be worth waiting for a pullback or a confirmation of the uptrend before entering a long position. Alternatively, a more aggressive approach could be taken with a tighter stop loss and a lower take profit level, but this would increase the risk of the trade.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-08-01</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-08-01<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 497.74<br /><br />**Open:** 521.0<br /><br />**High:** 527.17<br /><br />**Low:** 492.1<br /><br />**Adj Close:** 497.74<br /><br />**Volume:** 43,010,600<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* SMA_50: 490.69<br />* SMA_200: 376.18<br />* EMA_50: 488.15<br />* EMA_200: 390.28<br />* RSI_14: 45.43<br />* MACD_12_26_12: -5.71<br />* MACDh_12_26_12: 497.74<br />* MACDs_12_26_12: -5.03<br />* BBL_20_2.0: 431.17<br />* BBM_20_2.0: 483.68<br />* BBU_20_2.0: 536.19<br />* BBB_20_2.0: 429.07<br />* BBP_20_2.0: 482.2<br />* STOCHk_14_3_3: 31.76<br />* STOCHd_14_3_3: 45.5<br />* ATRr_14: 18.01<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />The last closing candle exhibited a bearish trend as the opening price was significantly higher than the previous close but the price dropped to close near the day's low.

This candle represents a bearish engulfing pattern, as the body of the candle completely engulfs the previous candle's body. This pattern may indicate a potential reversal in the trend.<br /><br />The Simple Moving Averages (SMA) for the last 50 and 200 periods are 63.54 and 56.21, respectively. The Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) for the same periods are 63.5 and 56.2. The close price is below both the SMA_50 and EMA_50, indicating a bearish trend.<br /><br />The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for the last 14 periods is 40.77, which is in the neutral zone (between 30 and 70), but closer to the oversold zone (below 30). This suggests that the security may be oversold and due for a rebound.<br /><br />The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) with 12-period and 26-period exponential moving averages and a 12-period signal line is -4.24, indicating a bearish trend. Both the MACD histogram and signal line are below zero, confirming the bearish trend.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands (BB) for the last 20 periods with a standard deviation of 2.0 show that the close price is at the lower end of the Bollinger Bands (BBL_20 2.0), with the middle band (BBM_20 2.0) and upper band (BBU_20 2.0) both being above the close price. The Bollinger Band Width (BBB_20 2.0) is relatively low (12.48), indicating that the price may be due for a breakout.<br /><br />The Bollinger Band Pivot (BBB_20 2.0) and Stop (BB Stop) are 65.72 and 62.32, respectively, with the close price being near the lower end of the Bollinger Bands.<br /><br />The Stochastic %K and %D for the last 14 periods with a slowing of 3 and a range of 3 are 25.19 and 26.01, respectively, both of which are in the oversold zone, suggesting that the security may be oversold and due for a rebound.<br /><br />The Average True Range (ATR) for the last 14 periods is 5.43, indicating that the price has been relatively volatile.<br /><br />Based on the last closing candle and the technical indicators, the security appears to be in a bearish trend, but it may be oversold and due for a rebound. An investor or trader considering a potential entry may want to consider a buy order with a stop loss below the BB Stop (62.32) and a take profit level above the BBU 20 2.0 (72.2) to achieve a 3:1 risk reward ratio. However, it is important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results, and the investor or trader should conduct their own research and analysis before making any investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='child-table MRVL'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent MRVL'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-08-02</td><td>slightly bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle:** 2024-08-02, Close Price: **59.25**<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />* Open Price: **60.56**, higher than close price, bearish candle.<br />* High Price: **60.82**, higher than close price, confirming bearish nature.<br />* Low Price: **57.98**, significantly lower than close price, strong downward pressure.<br />* Volume: **20174600**, higher than previous candles, increased trading activity.<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* SMA_50: **70.28**, significantly higher than close price, strong downtrend.<br />* SMA_200: **68.85**, higher than close price, further confirming downtrend.<br />* RSI_14: **34.9**, below 30, oversold condition, potential reversal.<br />* MACD_12_26_12: negative, bearish trend.<br /><br />**Entry Considerations:**<br /><br />* Stop Loss: high of last candle, **60.82**.<br />* Take Profit: 3x stop loss distance, **51.56**.<br />* Risk-Reward Ratio: 4.89:1.<br /><br />**Important Note:** This analysis is based solely on the provided price data and does not consider any fundamental or external factors.

However, the ATRr value indicates that the stock has been experiencing higher volatility, so traders should be cautious and consider setting stop-loss orders.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-25</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date Range:** 2024-04-26 to 2024-07-25<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 63.99<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 66.61<br /><br />**Price Change:** -2.62 points, -3.93%<br /><br />**High for the Day:** 69.56<br /><br />**Low for the Day:** 62.12<br /><br />**Trading Volume:** 13,515,432<br /><br />**50-Day Average Volume:** 69,855,500<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />| Indicator | Value |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| SMA_50 | 71.26 |<br />| SMA_200 | 65.01 |<br />| EMA_50 | 70.27 |<br />| EMA_200 | 62.04 |<br /><br />**RSI_14:** 36.64<br /><br />**MACD:**<br /><br />| Indicator | Value |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| MACD_12_26_12 | -1.39 |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12 | -1.08 |<br />| MACDs_12_26_12 | -0.3 |<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />| Indicator | Value |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| BBL_20_2.0 | 62.89 |<br />| BBM_20_2.0 | 69.56 |<br />| BBU_20_2.0 | 76.23 |<br />| BBB_20_2.0 | 65.01 |<br />| BBP_20_2.0 | 63.99 |<br /><br />**STOCHastic:**<br /><br />| Indicator | Value |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3 | 12.27 |<br />| STOCHd_14_3_3 | 16.23 |<br /><br />**ATR:** 3.13<br /><br />**Summary:**<br /><br />The last closing candle shows a bearish trend, with the stock closing below both the SMA_50 and EMA_50, and below the BBL_20_2.0 and BBM_20_2.0.

The RSI is also very low, indicating oversold conditions. However, the MACD histogram is positive, which suggests that the short-term trend may still be bullish.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Recommendations:**<br /><br />Based on the analysis, it may be a good time to be bearish. However, it's important to note that the MACD histogram suggests that the short-term trend may still be bullish. Therefore, a neutral position may also be appropriate.<br /><br />If you are looking for a potential entry, you may consider waiting for a bullish reversal signal, such as a bullish engulfing pattern or a hammer pattern, before entering a long position. If you are already in a long position, you may consider setting a stop loss below the recent low of 404.34.<br /><br />Assuming a 3:1 risk-reward ratio, the take profit level for a long position could be set at 404.34 + (404.34 x 3) = 525.64, while the stop loss level could be set at 404.34 - (404.34 x 0.25) = 303.25.

However, it's important to note that this is just a hypothetical example and actual entry and exit levels should be determined based on the specific chart patterns and technical indicators.<br /><br />It's important to remember that technical analysis is not a guarantee of future performance and should be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis, such as fundamental analysis and market news.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-08-01</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report******<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 101.51 (2024-08-01)<br /><br />**Price Data:**<br /><br />| **Metric** | **Value** |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| Open | 107.18 |<br />| High | 107.86 |<br />| Low | 99.95 |<br />| Close | 101.51 |<br />| Adj Close | 101.51 |<br />| Volume | 31564600 |<br />| SMA_50 | 128.47 |<br />| SMA_200 | 101.16 |<br />| EMA_50 | 122.31 |<br />| EMA_200 | 105.76 |<br />| RSI_14 | 31.95 |<br />| MACD_12_26_12 | -7.44 |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12 | -2.26 |<br />| MACDs_12_26_12 | -5.18 |<br />| BBL_20_2.0 | 94.34 |<br />| BBM_20_2.0 | 116.45 |<br />| BBU_20_2.0 | 138.56 |<br />| BBB_20_2.0 | 37.97 |<br />| BBP_20_2.0 | 0.16 |<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3 | 9.53 |<br />| STOCHd_14_3_3 | 9.52 |<br />| ATRr_14 | 5.57 |<br /><br />**Price Trend:** The last closing candle indicates a bearish trend.

The open price of 643.77 is higher than the close price, suggesting that the price may have peaked at the beginning of the day and then declined throughout the day. The high price of 646.99 is also higher than the close price, further supporting the idea that the price peaked at the beginning of the day.

The 200-day SMA is lower than the closing price, indicating a bullish trend in the longer term. The EMAs for 50 and 200 days are also bearish. The RSI for the past 14 periods is below the neutral level of 50, indicating a bearish trend. The MACD is negative, with the MACD line and signal line also bearish. The Bollinger bands show that the closing price is near the lower end of the range, indicating a potential oversold condition.<br /><br />Overall, the last closing candle suggests a bearish trend in the short term, with the price declining from the previous day's high.

It is recommended to wait for further confirmation of the trend before making any investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-30</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Last Closing Data**<br /><br />| Date          | Open  | High | Low  | Close | Adj Close | Volume |<br />| ------------- |-------|------|------|-------|-----------|--------|<br />| 2024-07-30    | 111.11| 112.15| 110.72| 111.93| 111.93   | 1,162,000|<br /><br />**Moving Averages**<br /><br />| Moving Average | Value |<br />| --------------|-------|<br />| SMA_50        | 106.25|<br />| SMA_200       | 100.82|<br />| EMA_50        | 106.52|<br />| EMA_200       | 101.76|<br /><br />**Technical Indicators**<br /><br />| Indicator     | Value |<br />| ------------- |-------|<br />| RSI_14       | 63.19 |<br />| MACD_12_26_12 | 1.21  |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12| 1.22  |<br />| MACDs_12_26_12| -0.0  |<br />| BBL_20_2.0  | 105.5 |<br />| BBM_20_2.0  | 109.03|<br />| BBU_20_2.0  | 112.57|<br />| BBB_20_2.0  | 105.24|<br />| BBP_20_2.0  | 108.73|<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3| 77.71 |<br />| STOCHd_14_3_3| 68.87 |<br />| ATRr_14       | 1.53  |<br /><br />**Observations**<br /><br />The last closing candle's date is 2024-07-30.

The close price is also below the 50-day and 200-day moving averages (SMA 50 and SMA 200), as well as the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA 50), which are all bearish signals.<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* The relative strength index (RSI) is at 43.9, which is below the neutral level of 50, indicating that the asset is oversold.<br />* The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is negative, with the signal line crossing below the MACD line, which is a bearish signal.<br />* The Bollinger bands show that the close price is near the lower Bollinger band, which is a bearish signal.<br />* The stochastic oscillator is also below the neutral level of 50, indicating a downtrend.<br /><br />**Potential Trade:**<br /><br />Based on this analysis, it may be a good time to be bearish on the asset. One possible entry could be a sell order at the current price of 237.75, with a stop loss at 242.02 (just above the upper Bollinger band) and a take profit level at 202.17 (a 3:1 risk reward ratio based on the distance from the entry price to the stop loss and the distance from the entry price to the take profit level).

Therefore, it may be a good time to be bearish on the stock, but investors should be cautious due to the stock's volatility.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-26</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Data:** 2024-07-26<br />----------------------------------<br /><br />Open price: **252.17**<br />High: **256.23**<br />Low: **250.62**<br />Close: **253.62**<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br />--------------------<br /><br />SMA_50: **272.23**<br />SMA_200: **235.01**<br /><br />EMA_50: **267.63**<br />EMA_200: **241.63**<br /><br />**Moving Average Crossover:**<br />----------------------------<br /><br />Short-term moving averages (SMA_50 and EMA_50) are above long-term moving averages (SMA_200 and EMA_200), which could indicate a bullish trend.<br /><br />**RSI (Relative Strength Index):**<br />--------------------------------<br /><br />RSI_14: **41.22** (below neutral level of 50)<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br />-----------------------------------------------<br /><br />MACD_12_26_12: negative<br />MACD line: **-3.42**<br />Signal line: **-3.97**<br /><br />**Histogram:**<br />------------<br /><br />Positive<br /><br />**ATRr_14 (Average True Range):**<br />--------------------------------<br /><br />**10.05**<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br />-------------------<br /><br />BBL_20_2.0, BBM_20_2.0, BBU_20_2.0, BBB_20_2.0, BBP_20_2.0, STOCHk_14_3_3, and STOCHd_14_3_3 indicators are not relevant for the last closing candle.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br />--------------<br /><br />The last closing candle suggests a mixed picture.

The RSI 14 is at 56.07, which is in the neutral zone and not indicating overbought or oversold conditions. The MACD indicators are positive, but the MACDs line is above the MACDh line, which is a bearish signal. The BBL, BBM, and BBU are all above the BBP, indicating a bearish market. The STOCHk and STOCHd are both above 80, indicating overbought conditions, but this is not confirmed by the price action. The ATRr is at 7.3, indicating high volatility.<br /><br />**Entry and Stop Loss Levels:**<br /><br />Given a 3:1 risk reward ratio, we would need to identify a potential exit price that is at least three times the distance from the entry price as the distance from the current close price to the nearest support level. Based on the price data provided, the nearest support level appears to be around 120, which is the SMA 50. Using this as the support level, we can calculate a potential entry price and stop loss level as follows:<br /><br />* Entry price: around 130 (above the current close price but below the SMA 50)<br />* Stop loss level: around 135 (above the entry price and the recent high)<br />* Take profit level: around 105 (three times the distance from the entry price to the support level)<br /><br />It's important to note that this is only a hypothetical example and should not be taken as investment advice.

This suggests bearish pressure, but the price managed to close above the opening price, indicating some bullish strength.<br /><br />**Moving Averages:** The 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA_50) was 1027.78, and the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA_200) was 1020.36. The SMA_50 was above the SMA_200, which is a bullish signal.

The price closed below both the short-term and long-term moving averages, which can be considered bearish.<br />2. **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA):** EMA_50 = 104.54, EMA_200 = 103.1. Similar to SMA, the price closed below both the short-term and long-term moving averages, suggesting a bearish outlook.<br />3. **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** RSI_14 = 41.22. An RSI below 50 indicates that the stock is oversold, but it is not extremely low, so it does not necessarily indicate a strong buy signal.<br />4. **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** MACD_12_26_12 = -1.89, MACDh_12_26_12 = -0.76, MACDs_12_26_12 = -1.13.

The price closed above the SMA 50 and EMA 50, which could be seen as a bullish sign. However, the price is also below the SMA 200 and EMA 200, which could be seen as a bearish sign. The RSI is at 46.87, which is close to neutral territory.<br /><br />The MACD is negative, but the MACDh and MACDs are both positive, which could be a bullish sign. The Bollinger Bands are relatively wide, with the price closing near the upper Bollinger Band, which could be a bullish sign. However, the BBB (bottom Bollinger Band) is also relatively high, indicating that the price has been volatile and could potentially move down.<br /><br />The Stochastic Oscillator is at 100.0, which is typically seen as an overbought level, but this could also be a sign of strong momentum.<br /><br />Overall, the last closing candle does not provide a clear signal to be bullish or bearish. However, if the price can break above the SMA 200 and EMA 200 with strong volume, it could be a bullish sign. Conversely, if the price breaks below the lower Bollinger Band with strong volume, it could be a bearish sign.<br /><br />**Trade Setup:**<br /><br />Based on a 3:1 risk reward ratio, if an investor were to enter a long position, a potential entry price could be around the SMA 200 or EMA 200, with a stop loss level below the lower Bollinger Band and a take profit level above the upper Bollinger Band. However, it is important to note that this is only a potential trade setup and should be evaluated in the context of the overall market conditions and the individual investor's risk tolerance.</td></tr><tr class='child-table PDD'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent PDD'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-08-02</td><td>slightly bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** (2024-08-02)<br /><br />**Closing Price:** 127.41<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 125.8<br /><br />**High:** 127.86<br /><br />**Low:** 124.37<br /><br />The stock closed near the day's low, opening slightly lower than the previous day's close but reaching a new high for the period.<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* 50-day SMA: 139.88<br />* 200-day SMA: 131.08<br /><br />Both short-term and long-term averages are above the closing price, indicating a bearish outlook.<br /><br />**Exponential Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* EMA 50: 135.15<br />* EMA 200: 126.51<br /><br />Both EMAs also suggest a bearish trend.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):**<br /><br />RSI: 30.54<br /><br />The RSI is below the neutral threshold of 30, indicating that the stock is oversold.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />MACD: -12.44<br /><br />Signal Line: -15.14<br /><br />Histogram: -2.7<br /><br />The MACD lines are bearish, with the MACD line below the signal line and a negative histogram.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />BBL: 122.41<br /><br />BBM: 139.88<br /><br />BBU: 157.35<br /><br />The stock is trading near the lower Bollinger Band, which could indicate a potential reversion to the mean.<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:**<br /><br />%K: 15.49<br /><br />%D: 16.21<br /><br />Both %K and %D are below the oversold threshold of 20, further supporting the oversold condition.<br /><br />**Average True Range (ATR):**<br /><br />ATR: 4.25<br /><br />The ATR can be used to gauge market volatility.<br /><br />Based on the provided data, the last closing candle suggests a bearish outlook due to the stock trading below its short-term and long-term averages, as well as oversold conditions.

The price has dropped from the open price of 160.52 to the close price of 159.31, representing a decrease of 0.75%. The volume for this candle is lower than previous candles, which could indicate a lack of buying interest.<br /><br />The short-term moving averages (SMA_50 and EMA_50) are both above the close price, indicating a bearish trend. The long-term moving averages (SMA_200 and EMA_200) are also above the close price, further confirming the bearish trend.<br /><br />The RSI_14 is at 33.08, which is below the oversold threshold of 30. This indicates that the asset is oversold and could potentially rebound in the short term.<br /><br />The MACD indicators are bearish, with the MACD line (-9.56) below the signal line (-3.97), indicating a downward trend. The histogram is also negative, further confirming the bearish trend.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands are also bearish, with the close price near the lower Bollinger Band. The BBU_20_2.0 is at 215.3, which is significantly higher than the current price, indicating a potential downside risk.<br /><br />The Stochastic indicators are also bearish, with the STOCHk_14_3_3 at 13.89 and the STOCHd_14_3_3 at 8.6. This indicates that the asset is oversold and could potentially rebound in the short term.<br /><br />**Potential Entry Point:**<br /><br />An investor looking for a potential entry point could consider a buy order at the lower Bollinger Band of 156.06, with a stop loss at 153.75 (BBB_20_2.0) and a take profit level at 164.0 (the high of the previous candle).

The price data for this candle is as follows:<br /><br />* Open: 549.08<br />* High: 555.95<br />* Low: 532.07<br />* Close: 536.03<br />* Adj Close: 536.03<br />* Volume: 3209091<br />* SMA 50: 532.11<br />* SMA 200: 462.53<br />* EMA 50: 528.82<br />* EMA 200: 460.21<br />* RSI 14: 46.7<br />* MACD 12 26 12: -1.45<br />* MACDh 12 26 12: 7.44<br />* MACDs 12 26 12: N/A<br />* BBL 20 2.0: 518.52<br />* BBM 20 2.0: 547.12<br />* BBU 20 2.0: 575.72<br />* BBB 20 2.0: 532.11<br />* BBP 20 2.0: 555.95<br />* STOCHk 14 3 3: N/A<br />* STOCHd 14 3 3: N/A<br />* ATRr 14: 20.34<br /><br />The close price (536.03) is lower than the open price (549.08) and also lower than the previous week's close price (554.79), indicating a bearish trend. The price has moved below the 50-day moving average (532.11) and the 200-day moving average (462.53), which could be a sign of a downward trend. The RSI is at 46.7, which is neutral, but the MACD histogram is negative (-1.45) indicating a bearish momentum.<br /><br />**Entry Consideration:**<br /><br />With a 3:1 risk reward ratio, it is important to first determine the stop loss and take profit levels. A conservative approach would be to set the stop loss above the most recent high (555.95) and the take profit level below the most recent low (532.07). This would give a risk reward ratio of approximately 1:2, which is still considered good.<br /><br />Therefore, if an investor is willing to take on this risk, they could consider entering a short position at the current price (536.03) with a stop loss at 556.03 (555.95 + 20.34*2) and a take profit level at 516.03 (536.03 - 20.34*3). However, it is important to note that this is only an example and the actual stop loss and take profit levels should be determined based on the investor's risk tolerance and investment strategy.</td></tr><tr class='child-table ROP'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent ROP'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-08-02</td><td>slightly bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report******<br /><br />**Last Closing Data:** 2024-08-02<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 536.03<br /><br />**Change from Previous Day:** -3.8 points<br /><br />**Open Price:** 546.9<br /><br />**High:** 548.01<br /><br />**Low:** 532.07<br /><br />**Volume:** 740000<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* SMA_50: 552.97<br />* SMA_200: 538.04<br /><br />**Exponential Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* EMA_50: 551.79<br />* EMA_200: 533.29<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* RSI_14: 31.2<br />* MACD_12_26_12: -3.65<br />* BBL_20_2.0: 526.18<br />* BBM_20_2.0: 551.7<br />* BBU_20_2.0: 577.21<br />* BBB_20_2.0: 536.03<br />* BBP_20_2.0: -3.8<br />* STOCHk_14_3_3: 1.9<br />* STOCHd_14_3_3: 1.1<br /><br />**Candle Analysis:** The last closing candle indicates a bearish outlook for this asset.

This candle is a **bearish candle**, as the close price is lower than the open price, indicating that selling pressure was stronger than buying pressure during this period.<br /><br />**Volume**<br />--------<br /><br />The **volume** for this candle was **5,513,115**, which is **slightly above the average** volume for this time period. This suggests that there was a significant amount of trading activity during this period.<br /><br />**Moving Averages**<br />------------------<br /><br />The **SMA_50 (Simple Moving Average over 50 periods)** is **170.19**, and the **SMA_200 (Simple Moving Average over 200 periods)** is **134.34**. The **EMA_50 (Exponential Moving Average over 50 periods)** is **170.52**, and the **EMA_200 (Exponential Moving Average over 200 periods)** is **134.48**. These moving averages can be used to identify trends and potential support and resistance levels. The fact that the close price is below both the SMA_50 and EMA_50 suggests that the trend is downward.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI_14)**<br />----------------------------------<br /><br />The **RSI_14 (Relative Strength Index over 14 periods)** is **8.93**. This is a momentum oscillator that can be used to identify overbought and oversold conditions. A reading below 30 suggests that the asset is oversold, while a reading above 70 suggests that the asset is overbought. The fact that the RSI is well below 30 suggests that the asset is oversold, which could indicate a potential buying opportunity.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**<br />---------------------------------------------<br /><br />The **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)** indicators are also bearish.

The volume is slightly above average, and the moving averages suggest a downward trend. The RSI is well below 30, indicating that the asset is oversold, which could be a potential buying opportunity. However, the MACD indicators are also bearish, so it may be advisable to wait for further confirmation before entering a long position.<br /><br />**Potential Entry, Stop Loss, and Take Profit Levels**<br />--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />If you do decide to enter a long position, a 3:1 risk reward ratio would suggest an entry price of around **204.72**, with a stop loss level of around **201.71** and a take profit level of around **215.22**.

The price closed above both the short-term (SMA_50) and long-term (SMA_200) simple moving averages, which can be interpreted as a bullish signal. The relative strength index (RSI) is at 61.37, which is above the neutral level of 50, but still below the overbought level of 70, suggesting that there is some room for further price increases.<br /><br />The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicators are also slightly bullish, with the MACD line (12-day EMA - 26-day EMA) being above the signal line (9-day EMA of MACD line). The Bollinger Bands show that the price is near the upper band, which can be a sign of the price being overextended, but the bands have also expanded, indicating increased volatility.<br /><br />In conclusion, the last closing candle suggests a slightly bullish market sentiment, but investors should be cautious due to the increased volatility and the possibility of the price being overextended. It is essential to consider additional factors and perform further analysis before making any investment decisions.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr class='parent-row slight_sell inconclusive_daily' id='SBUX'><td>SBUX</td><td>Starbucks Corporation Common Stock</td><td>2024-08-02</td><td>slightly bearish</td></tr><tr class='explanation-table SBUX'><td colspan='4'>**Weekly Stock Market Analysis**---------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle Data:**<br />---------------------------<br /><br />| **Date**          | **Price** |<br />|------------------|-----------|<br />| 2024-07-29        | 75.88     |<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle Key Points:**<br />----------------------------------<br /><br />* Open price: 74.39<br />* High price: 81.24<br />* Low price: 73.72<br />* Volume: 93,601,788<br /><br />**Technical Details:**<br />---------------------<br /><br />* 50-day SMA: 90.02<br />* 200-day SMA: 90.56<br />* 50-day EMA: 91.19<br />* 200-day EMA: 91.04<br />* RSI: 42.3<br />* MACD: -4.24<br />* Signal line: -0.13<br />* Upper Bollinger Band: 87.29<br />* Middle Bollinger Band: 91.04<br />* Lower Bollinger Band: 94.8<br />* Stochastic oscillator: (80.83, 57.83)<br /><br />**Interpretation:**<br />------------------<br /><br />The last closing candle does not provide a clear signal for investors and traders.

The price opened at 71.96, reached a high of 72.19, but then dropped to a low of 71.11 before closing at 71.68. This is a bearish engulfing pattern, where the body of the candle completely engulfs the previous candle's body, indicating a potential reversal in the trend.<br /><br />The RSI value is 46.39, which is not in the overbought or oversold territory, suggesting that the price drop is not due to extreme market conditions. The MACD lines are also bearish, with the signal line crossing below the MACD line.<br /><br />Considering the moving averages, the SMA_50 is below the SMA_200, indicating a bearish trend. The EMA_50 is also above the EMA_200, but it has started to flatten, suggesting a potential trend reversal.<br /><br />Based on this analysis, it might be a good time to consider a bearish position, but it's essential to wait for confirmation of the trend reversal. If the price breaks below the BBU_20_2.0 level at 73.48, it could be a good entry point for a short position. A 3:1 risk-reward ratio could be achieved by setting the stop loss at 73.48 and the take profit level at 66.99 (73.48 - (73.48 x 3) = 66.99). However, it's crucial to monitor the market conditions and adjust the strategy accordingly.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-08-01</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-08-01<br /><br />**Close:** **72.94**<br /><br />**Bearish Signal:** The closing price of 72.94 is lower than the previous day's close of 73.22, indicating a bearish trend.<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* **Simple Moving Averages:**<br />  + SMA_50: 71.54<br />  + SMA_200: 68.23<br />  The close price is above both the SMA_50 and SMA_200, which is typically a bullish sign.<br /><br />* **Exponential Moving Averages:**<br />  + EMA_50: 72.05<br />  + EMA_200: 68.2<br />  The close price is above both the EMA_50 and EMA_200, which is a bullish sign.<br /><br />* **Relative Strength Index (RSI_14):** 56.83<br />  The RSI_14 is in the neutral zone (between 30 and 70), indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.<br /><br />* **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD_12_26_12):** -0.03, MACDh_12_26_12: 0.22, MACDs_12_26_12: -0.25<br />  The MACD lines are close to crossing, which could indicate a bearish trend.<br /><br />* **Bollinger Bands:**<br />  + BBL_20_2.0: 71.03<br />  + BBM_20_2.0: 72.28<br />  + BBU_20_2.0: 73.53<br />  The close price is at the lower end of the band, which is a bearish signal.<br /><br />* **Stochastic Oscillator:**<br />  + STOCHk_14_3_3: 71.03<br />  + STOCHd_14_3_3: 72.28<br />  The STOCHk line is below the STOCHd line, which is a bearish signal.<br /><br />* **Average True Range (ATRr_14):** 1.04<br />  The ATRr_14 indicates high volatility.<br /><br />**Conclusion:** The last closing candle indicates a bearish trend, with the close price decreasing from the previous day and several technical indicators supporting this trend.

This indicates that the MACD line is below the signal line, which is a bearish signal.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands (BB)**<br />-----------------------<br /><br />The stock is trading below the lower band. The lower band (BBB_20_2.0) is at **511.36**, and the close for the last candle is **525.89**. This indicates that the stock is trading at a lower price than its recent historical average.<br /><br />**Average True Range (ATR)**<br />----------------------------<br /><br />The ATR for 14 days (ATRr_14) is **18.36**. This indicates that the stock has been experiencing a high degree of volatility recently.<br /><br />**Conclusion**<br />------------<br /><br />Based on this analysis, the last closing candle indicates a bearish trend, with the stock trading below its long-term and short-term moving averages, oversold, and experiencing a high degree of volatility. However, the RSI_14 suggests that the stock may be due for a rebound. Therefore, it may be a good time to be cautious and consider a neutral or bearish position. However, investors should also consider other factors, such as market conditions and news events, before making a decision.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-26</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Price Data:** (587.17, 549.33, 582.31, 543.15)<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle:** A bullish candle with a closing price of 546.38, higher than the opening price of 548.36.

The take profit level could be determined based on the risk-reward ratio, but a 3:1 risk-reward ratio would suggest a take profit level around 57.05 (current price + (current price x 3)).

The Bollinger Bands show the price breaking below the lower band, which is also a bearish signal.<br /><br />Based on historical data, a potential entry point for a short position could be around the 50-week SMA of 51.2, with a target price of 43.41, which is the lower Bollinger Band and also the recent low. This would give a risk-reward ratio of approximately 3:1. However, it is important to note that this is based on historical data and there is no guarantee that the stock will continue to trend downwards. It is always important to consider other market and company-specific factors when making investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='child-table WFC'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent WFC'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-08-02</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-08-02<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle:**<br /><br />- Open: 55.18<br />- High: 55.57<br />- Close: 53.26<br />- Adjusted Close: 53.26<br /><br />The **last closing candle** indicates a **significant price decrease**, with the close being lower than the open.<br /><br />**Volume:**<br /><br />- Volume: 27626000<br /><br />The **volume** for this candle is higher than previous candles, suggesting **increased trading activity**.<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />- SMA_50: 58.89<br />- SMA_200: 53.07<br /><br />The **SMA_50** is above the **SMA_200**, indicating a potential **downtrend**.<br /><br />- EMA_50: 54.29<br />- EMA_200: 53.08<br /><br />The **EMA_50** is below the **EMA_200**, suggesting a potential **uptrend**.<br /><br />**Indicators:**<br /><br />- RSI_14: 29.54<br /><br />The **RSI_14** is below 30, indicating that the asset is **oversold** and may be due for a correction.<br /><br />- MACD_12_26_12: -1.83<br />- MACDh_12_26_12: -1.52<br />- MACDs_12_26_12: -2.15<br /><br />The **MACD_12_26_12** is negative, indicating a **bearish signal**.

However, any trading decision should be based on a thorough analysis of the market and a consideration of the trader's risk tolerance and investment goals.</td></tr><tr class='child-table XOM'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent XOM'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-08-02</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 116.88 (2024-08-02)<br /><br />**Open Price:** 115.97<br /><br />**High:** 118.87<br /><br />**Low:** 115.42<br /><br />**Adjusted Close:** 116.88<br /><br />**Volume:** 204,001,000<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />| Indicator  | Value                 |<br />| ----------- | ---------------------- |<br />| SMA_50      | 114.11                 |<br />| SMA_200     | 109.48                 |<br />| EMA_50      | 114.98                 |<br />| EMA_200     | 111.59                 |<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />The 50-day and 200-day moving averages are both trending upwards, with the 50-day moving average above the 200-day moving average, indicating a bullish trend.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| Indicator  | Value                 |<br />| ----------- | ---------------------- |<br />| RSI_14     | 64.15                 |<br />| MACD_12_26_12 | 1.47, -0.07, 0.34     |<br />| BBL_20_2.0 | 114.11                 |<br />| BBM_20_2.0 | 116.88                 |<br />| BBU_20_2.0 | 121.83                 |<br />| BBB_20_2.0 | 114.11                 |<br />| BBP_20_2.0 | 116.88                 |<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3 | 87.5                 |<br />| STOCHd_14_3_3 | 85.5                 |<br />| ATRr_14    | 2.31                 |<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />The RSI_14 is 64.15, which is above the neutral level of 50, indicating that the stock is currently overbought.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also above 50, indicating that the bullish momentum is still present.<br /><br />However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram is starting to flatten, which could be a sign that the uptrend is losing some momentum. The Bollinger Bands are expanding, indicating increasing volatility in the market. The price is currently near the upper Bollinger Band, which could be a sign of overbought conditions. However, the price has been able to break above the upper Bollinger Band in the past, so this may not necessarily be a bearish signal.<br /><br />Overall, the last closing candle suggests that the market is still in a bullish trend, but there are some signs that the uptrend may be losing some momentum. Investors and traders may want to exercise caution and consider taking profits or implementing risk management strategies. However, based on the information provided, there is no clear signal to be bullish, bearish, or neutral. It is recommended to consider other factors and indicators before making a decision.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-25</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-25<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 115.17<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 115.17<br /><br />**High Price:** 118.03<br /><br />**Low Price:** 114.57<br /><br />**Volume:** 12,200,642<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| Indicator | Value |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| SMA_50 | 114.23 |<br />| SMA_200 | 109.23 |<br />| EMA_50 | 114.43 |<br />| EMA_200 | 111.23 |<br />| RSI_14 | 58.12 |<br />| MACD_12_26_12 | 0.34 |<br /><br />**Trend Analysis:**<br /><br />The last closing candle indicates a slightly bullish trend, as the close price is higher than the previous day's close and above the SMA_50 and EMA_50.
