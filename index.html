The STOCHk_14_3_3 (14-day Stochastic %K) is at 46.84, which is below the oversold level of 20, and the STOCHd_14_3_3 (14-day Stochastic %D) is at 57.96, which is above the oversold level of 20, indicating a mixed signal.<br />6. The ATRr_14 (14-day Average True Range Ratio) is at 5.19, which is relatively low, suggesting that the price volatility is decreasing.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle shows a mix of bearish and neutral signals. The close price is below major moving averages, and the MACD is negative, suggesting a bearish trend. However, the RSI is not significantly oversold, and the Bollinger Bands are narrow, indicating a potential consolidation. Traders and investors should consider these factors and exercise caution when making decisions.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr class='parent-row buy buy_daily' id='ABBV'><td>ABBV</td><td>AbbVie Inc.

However, the short-term and long-term moving averages are very close to each other and to the current price, suggesting a lack of clear trend direction.<br /><br />The RSI 14 is at 42.06, which is below the neutral midpoint of 50, indicating that the stock is currently oversold. However, this is not a strong oversold signal, as the RSI is still above 30.<br /><br />The MACD 12 26 12 is showing a bearish signal, as the 12-day EMA is crossing below the 26-day EMA. However, the MACDh 12 26 12 is above the neutral midpoint of 0, suggesting that the bearish signal is not particularly strong.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands (BBL 20 2.0, BBM 20 2.0, and BBU 20 2.0) indicate that the stock is currently near the lower Bollinger Band, which is consistent with the oversold signal from the RSI.<br /><br />The Stochastic Oscillator (STOCHk 14 3 3 and STOCHd 14 3 3) is showing a bearish signal, as the 14-day %K is crossing below the 14-day %D. However, this signal is not particularly strong, as the %D is still above the neutral midpoint of 50.<br /><br />The ATRr 14 is at 8.8, indicating that the stock has been experiencing relatively low volatility recently.<br /><br />Overall, the last closing candle does not provide a clear signal for investors and traders. The oversold signal from the RSI and the lower Bollinger Band suggest that the stock may be due for a rebound, but the bearish signals from the MACD and Stochastic indicators suggest that the stock may continue to decline.

Overall, the last closing candle suggests that the stock may be overbought and due for a correction, but the bullish trend is still intact.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-24</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle:** _2024-07-24_<br /><br />**Candle Values:**<br /><br />| **Metric**          | **Value** |<br />|---------------------|-----------|<br />| Open                | 329.38    |<br />| High                | 332.54    |<br />| Low                 | 328.14    |<br />| Close               | 328.68    |<br />| Adj Close           | 328.68    |<br />| Volume              | 3,285,100 |<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| **Indicator**          | **Value** |<br />|-----------------------|-----------|<br />| SMA_50               | 302.75    |<br />| SMA_200              | 329.69    |<br />| EMA_50               | 310.44    |<br />| EMA_200              | 320.22    |<br />| RSI_14              | 69.81     |<br />| MACD_12_26_12       | 8.28      |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12     | 3.26      |<br />| MACDs_12_26_12     | 5.02      |<br />| BBL_20_2.0          | 289.22    |<br />| BBM_20_2.0          | 312.29    |<br />| BBU_20_2.0          | 335.37    |<br />| BBB_20_2.0          | 308.28    |<br />| BBP_20_2.0          | 325.41    |<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3       | 89.61     |<br />| STOCHd_14_3_3       | 86.71     |<br />| ATRr_14             | 6.72      |<br /><br />**Analysis:**<br /><br />The last closing candle for the stock market analysis shows a decrease in price compared to the opening price, with a closing value of 328.68, which is below the opening price of 329.38.

The price opened slightly higher than the previous close but then dropped and fluctuated throughout the day before closing slightly lower than the open. The volume for this candle is also lower than the previous day.<br /><br />The short-term moving averages (SMA_50 and EMA_50) are both above the price, indicating a downtrend in the short term. However, the long-term moving averages (SMA_200 and EMA_200) are both below the price, indicating an overall uptrend in the long term.<br /><br />The RSI is at 46.14, which is in neutral territory and does not indicate overbought or oversold conditions. The MACD is slightly negative, but not significantly, indicating a weak downtrend.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands are relatively wide, indicating high volatility. The price is currently near the lower Bollinger Band, which could indicate a buying opportunity. However, the STOCHastic oscillator is currently above 80, indicating overbought conditions, which could suggest caution for buyers.<br /><br />Overall, the last closing candle does not provide a clear signal for traders and investors. The short-term downtrend is not supported by the long-term uptrend, and the indicators are mixed. Therefore, a neutral or cautious approach may be appropriate.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-25</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 220.92 (2024-07-25)<br /><br />**Price Change:** Slight increase from the open price of 217.3<br /><br />**Trading Volume:** 5,098,611, above the average volume<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| **Indicator**          | **Value**          |<br />|-----------------------|-------------------|<br />| 50-day SMA             | 230.65            |<br />| 200-day SMA            | 198.74            |<br />| 50-day EMA            | 230.4             |<br />| 200-day EMA            | 198.5             |<br />| Current Price vs 50-day SMA | Below             |<br />| Current Price vs 200-day SMA | Below             |<br />| RSI                   | 41.06             |<br />| MACD (12, 26, 12)     | -1.99             |<br />| Bollinger Bands        | Below lower band  |<br />| Stochastic Oscillator | 2.01              |<br /><br />**Trend Analysis:**<br /><br />The stock is currently trading below both the 50 and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), indicating a bearish trend.

The technical indicators for this candle are as follows:<br /><br />* The Simple Moving Average (SMA) for the 50-day period was 229.54, and the 200-day SMA was 197.96.<br />* The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for the 50-day period was also 229.54, and the 200-day EMA was 197.96.<br />* The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for the 14-day period was 43.62.<br />* The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) lines were 1.1, 2.37, and -1.28 for the 12-day, 26-day, and 9-day periods, respectively.<br />* The Bollinger Bands (BB) values for the 20-day period were 222.62 (Lower Band), 233.09 (Middle Band), and 243.56 (Upper Band).<br />* The Bollinger Bands Percentage (BBP) was -8.98.<br />* The Stochastic Oscillator (STOCH) values for the 14-day period were 22.62 (Fast K) and 34.19 (Slow D).<br />* The Average True Range (ATR) for the 14-day period was 47.4.<br /><br />Based on the last closing candle and the technical indicators, the current trend appears to be bearish. The price closed below the open, SMA_50, SMA_200, EMA_50, and EMA_200, indicating a downtrend. The RSI value of 43.62 suggests that the stock is oversold, but this is not enough to reverse the bearish trend. The MACD lines are positive, but the MACDs line is below the MACDh line, indicating a weak bullish signal. The BBP value of -8.98 is below the oversold threshold of -8%, indicating a strong bearish signal. The STOCH values are also below the oversold threshold of 20%, indicating a strong bearish signal. The ATR value of 47.4 suggests high volatility in the stock price.<br /><br />Therefore, it may be a good time to be bearish on this stock, but it is essential to consider other factors such as fundamental analysis and market conditions before making a trading decision.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-23</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Last Closing Data:** _2024-07-23_<br /><br />**Price Data:**<br /><br />| **Metric**          | **Value** |<br />|---------------------|-----------|<br />| Open                 | 234.1     |<br />| High                 | 236.92    |<br />| Low                  | 229.03    |<br />| Close                | 230.32    |<br />| Adj Close            | 230.32    |<br />| Volume              | 3697328   |<br /><br />**Price Change:**<br /><br />* Decrease from previous day's close: 9.72 points<br />* Percentage decrease: 4.05%<br /><br />**Comparison with Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* 50-day SMA: 230.05<br />* 200-day SMA: 198.24<br />* Close is above 50-day SMA but below 200-day SMA<br /><br />**Comparison with Exponential Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* 50-day EMA: 230.21<br />* 200-day EMA: 198.41<br />* Close is above 50-day EMA but below 200-day EMA<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** RSI-14: 47.91 (neutral)<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />* MACD line: -2.08<br />* Signal line: -1.42<br />* Bearish signal<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />* Upper band: 243.84<br />* Middle band (20-day SMA): 230.05<br />* Lower band: 216.26<br />* Close near lower band, indicating potential oversold condition<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:** Stochastic Oscillator-14, 3, 3: 3.31 (oversold)<br /><br />**Conclusion:** The last closing candle indicates a bearish trend, with the price dropping significantly from the previous day's close.

The price has closed below both the 50-week and 200-week simple moving averages (SMAs), as well as below the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA). The relative strength index (RSI) is below 50, indicating that the stock is oversold, but this is not necessarily a bullish sign in the context of a longer-term downtrend.<br /><br />The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicators are also bearish, with the MACD line crossing below the signal line. The Bollinger Bands show that the price has fallen below the lower band, which is a bearish sign. The stock is also trading below the upper and lower bands of the Keltner channel, which is another bearish indicator.<br /><br />Overall, the last closing candle suggests that the stock is in a downtrend and that it may be a good time to adopt a bearish or neutral stance.

However, it is essential to monitor the price action and the technical indicators closely, as the market can change rapidly, and a reversal may occur at any time.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-23</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report (2024-07-23)***<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle:**<br />- Open price: 90.7<br />- High: 91.69<br />- Low: 89.83<br />- Close: 90.94<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br />- SMA_50: 102.21<br />- SMA_200: 99.62<br />- EMA_50: 101.54<br />- EMA_200: 100.87<br /><br />**The stock closed below:**<br />- SMA_50 and SMA_200<br /><br />**RSI:**<br />- RSI_14: 21.32<br />- RSI_14 below 30 threshold<br /><br />**MACD:**<br />- MACD_12_26_12: 2.03<br />- MACDh_12_26_12: 1.02<br />- MACDs_12_26_12: -0.99<br /><br />**Bearish Indicators:**<br />- BBL_20_2.0, BBM_20_2.0, BBU_20_2.0, BBB_20_2.0, BBP_20_2.0<br />- STOCHk_14_3_3, STOCHd_14_3_3<br /><br />**ATR:**<br />- ATRr_14: 1.78<br /><br />**Trend:**<br />- Bearish trend in the past few days<br /><br />**Summary:**<br />The last closing candle exhibited a small bullish engulfing pattern, but the overall trend in the past few days has been bearish.

Trend and Momentum**<br /><br />The last closing candle (2024-07-26) shows a slight increase in price from the previous day's close of 769.31. The short-term trend may be slightly downward, as indicated by the EMA_50 and EMA_200 being lower than the closing price. However, the long-term trend is still slightly upward, as indicated by the SMA_200 being higher than the closing price.<br /><br />There are some indications of upward momentum in the stock, as indicated by the positive MACD value and the price being slightly above the middle Bollinger Band. However, the stochastic oscillator suggests that the stock may be oversold in the short-term, which could lead to a potential rebound.<br /><br />The increased volatility, as indicated by the relatively high ATR, could lead to increased price swings and uncertainty in the trend.<br /><br />**Conclusion**<br /><br />The data is somewhat mixed and does not provide a clear signal to be bullish or bearish. A neutral stance may be appropriate until there is more clarity in the trend. The short-term trend may be slightly downward, but the long-term trend is still slightly upward. There are some indications of upward momentum and increased volatility, but the stochastic oscillator suggests that the stock may be oversold in the short-term.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-25</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**__________________________________________<br /><br />**Closing Price:** 769.31 (2024-07-25)<br /><br />**Open Price:** 797.3<br /><br />**High Price:** 801.74<br /><br />**Low Price:** 767.63<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* **SMA_50:** 775.86<br />* **SMA_200:** 790.05<br />* **EMA_50:** 779.01<br />* **EMA_200:** 789.83<br />* **RSI_14:** 34.43<br />* **MACD:** Bearish<br />* **BBL_20_2.0:** 740.28<br />* **STOCHk_14_3_3:** 20.16<br />* **ATRr_14:** 17.1<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />* The closing price is below both the SMA_50 and SMA_200, indicating a bearish trend.<br />* The EMA_50 and EMA_200 also show the closing price below their respective levels, further supporting the bearish trend.<br />* The RSI_14 is below 50, indicating a downtrend.<br />* The MACD line is below the signal line, and both lines are negative, suggesting a bearish trend.<br />* The BBL_20_2.0 is below the closing price, indicating oversold conditions.<br />* The STOCHk_14_3_3 is below 50, indicating a downtrend.<br />* The ATRr_14 is high, indicating increased volatility.<br /><br />**Conclusion:** Based on the provided technical indicators, the current trend appears to be bearish.

This is the lowest close in the past few days, as the price has been generally decreasing since 2024-07-17.<br /><br />V. Moving Average Analysis<br /><br />The moving averages show that the EMA_50 (631.93) and SMA_50 (625.88) are still above the EMA_200 (601.08) and SMA_200 (608.58), suggesting a bullish trend in the long term.

This might be a good time for investors to consider a bullish stance, but they should be cautious due to the weakening short-term trend and the potential for a bearish reversal.

However, it is important to note that technical analysis is not a guarantee of future performance, and other factors such as fundamental analysis and market conditions should also be taken into account when making investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='child-table MDLZ'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent MDLZ'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-30</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Report**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-30<br /><br />**Closing Price:** 67.05<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Technical Analysis**<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA_50): 67.04<br />* 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA_200): 69.84<br />* 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA_50): 67.06<br />* 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA_200): 69.81<br /><br />**Price in Relation to Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* Price is below both SMA_50 and EMA_50, which are close together and slightly declining, indicating a potential downtrend.<br />* Price is also below SMA_200 and EMA_200, which are both relatively flat, suggesting a longer-term bearish outlook.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):**<br /><br />* RSI_14: 49.41<br /><br />**Price Action and RSI:**<br /><br />* The RSI_14 is near the 50-midpoint, indicating a neutral bias in the short term.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />* MACD_12_26_12 line: -0.04<br />* MACDh_12_26_12: 0.25<br />* MACDs_12_26_12: -0.29<br /><br />**MACD Signals:**<br /><br />* The MACD lines are close to crossing, with the MACD_12_26_12 line above the MACDs_12_26_12 line, which could be a bullish signal if the MACD line crosses above the signal line.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />* BBL_20_2.0: 65.05<br />* BBM_20_2.0: 66.46<br />* BBU_20_2.0: 67.87<br />* BBB_20_2.0: 65.05<br />* BBP_20_2.0: 66.46<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands and Price:**<br /><br />* BBL_20_2.0 and BBM_20_2.0 are below their respective BBU_20_2.0 and BBB_20_2.0 levels, suggesting bearish pressure.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:**<br /><br />* STOCHk_14_3_3: 65.05<br />* STOCHd_14_3_3: 66.46<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator and Price:**<br /><br />* STOCHk_14_3_3 and STOCHd_14_3_3 are below their oversold levels (80), indicating that the downtrend might continue.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Average True Range (ATR):**<br /><br />* ATRr_14: 1.16<br /><br />**ATR and Volatility:**<br /><br />* ATRr_14 is relatively low, suggesting decreased volatility in the short term.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />Considering the technical indicators, the last closing candle does not provide a clear signal to be bullish or bearish.

The ATR value is relatively low, indicating that the market volatility is decreasing.<br /><br />Based on the analysis of the last closing candle and its relevant technical indicators, the market appears to be in a weak bearish phase. However, the RSI and Stochastic Oscillator values suggest that the market is not demonstrating strong bearish momentum either.

The MACD lines are below the signal line, which is a bearish sign.<br /><br />The Average True Range (ATRr_14) for the last closing candle is 3.07, which is a measure of volatility. A higher ATRr value indicates higher price volatility.<br /><br />In summary, the last closing candle has a close price below both the short and long-term moving averages, as well as a bearish MACD. The RSI is in the neutral zone but closer to the oversold region. These indicators suggest that the stock may be experiencing downward pressure and could be a bearish investment. However, the ATRr value indicates that the stock has been experiencing higher volatility, so traders should be cautious and consider setting stop-loss orders.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-25</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date Range:** 2024-04-26 to 2024-07-25<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 63.99<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 66.61<br /><br />**Price Change:** -2.62 points, -3.93%<br /><br />**High for the Day:** 69.56<br /><br />**Low for the Day:** 62.12<br /><br />**Trading Volume:** 13,515,432<br /><br />**50-Day Average Volume:** 69,855,500<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />| Indicator | Value |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| SMA_50 | 71.26 |<br />| SMA_200 | 65.01 |<br />| EMA_50 | 70.27 |<br />| EMA_200 | 62.04 |<br /><br />**RSI_14:** 36.64<br /><br />**MACD:**<br /><br />| Indicator | Value |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| MACD_12_26_12 | -1.39 |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12 | -1.08 |<br />| MACDs_12_26_12 | -0.3 |<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />| Indicator | Value |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| BBL_20_2.0 | 62.89 |<br />| BBM_20_2.0 | 69.56 |<br />| BBU_20_2.0 | 76.23 |<br />| BBB_20_2.0 | 65.01 |<br />| BBP_20_2.0 | 63.99 |<br /><br />**STOCHastic:**<br /><br />| Indicator | Value |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3 | 12.27 |<br />| STOCHd_14_3_3 | 16.23 |<br /><br />**ATR:** 3.13<br /><br />**Summary:**<br /><br />The last closing candle shows a bearish trend, with the stock closing below both the SMA_50 and EMA_50, and below the BBL_20_2.0 and BBM_20_2.0.

Investors and traders should consider these factors and exercise caution when making decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-23</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**---------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle Details**<br />-----------------------------<br /><br />| **Date** | **2024-07-23** |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| **Open** | 444.0 |<br />| **High** | 448.39 |<br />| **Low** | 443.25 |<br />| **Close** | 443.86 |<br />| **Adjusted Close** | 443.86 |<br />| **Volume** | 79,030,080 |<br /><br />**Calculated Values**<br />--------------------<br /><br />| **Indicator** | **Value** |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| SMA_50 | Not available |<br />| SMA_200 | Not available |<br />| EMA_50 | Not available |<br />| EMA_200 | Not available |<br />| RSI_14 | Not available |<br />| MACD_12_26_12 | Not available |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12 | Not available |<br />| MACDs_12_26_12 | Not available |<br />| BBL_20_2.0 | Not available |<br />| BBM_20_2.0 | Not available |<br />| BBU_20_2.0 | Not available |<br />| BBB_20_2.0 | Not available |<br />| BBP_20_2.0 | Not available |<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3 | Not available |<br />| STOCHd_14_3_3 | Not available |<br />| ATRr_14 | Not available |<br /><br />**Analysis**<br />----------<br /><br />The last closing candle shows a slight decrease in the Close price compared to the Open price, with a narrow range between the High and Low prices.

The 50-day SMA was above the 200-day SMA, which is typically a bullish sign. However, the close of the last candle was below both SMAs, which could be a bearish sign.<br />* The 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) was **271.91**, and the 200-day EMA was **235.29**. Once again, the 50-day EMA was above the 200-day EMA, but the close of the last candle was below both EMAs.<br />* The relative strength index (RSI) was **40.66**, which was below the neutral level of 50.

However, the histogram has been decreasing, which might indicate a weakening of the upward trend.<br />* The Bollinger Bands show that the stock has broken above the upper band, which is a strong bullish signal. The stock price is currently near the upper Bollinger Band, which might suggest a short-term pullback, but the overall trend remains bullish.<br />* The stochastic oscillator (both %K and %D) is above 80, indicating that the stock is overbought.

The close price is slightly lower than the open price, but the difference is minimal. The volume is also lower than the previous day, which could suggest a lack of interest from buyers or sellers.<br /><br />The RSI_14 is at 46.39, which is close to the neutral zone of 50. This suggests that the stock is not overbought or oversold. The MACD indicators are also close to zero, indicating a lack of momentum in either direction.<br /><br />The SMA and EMA indicators show that the stock is trading below both the 50 and 200-day moving averages, which could be a bearish signal. However, the Bollinger Bands show that the stock is still within the upper and lower bands, indicating that the stock is still within its normal range.<br /><br />In conclusion, the last closing candle does not provide a clear signal for traders and investors. The lack of momentum and volume suggests that the stock may continue to trade within its current range. A break above the 50 or 200-day moving averages could be a bullish signal, while a break below the lower Bollinger Band could be a bearish signal. However, further analysis and confirmation would be needed before making any trading decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-22</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report: id: 2024-07-22**<br /><br />**Open:** 59.9<br />**High:** 60.79<br />**Low:** 59.52<br />**Close:** 60.77<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />**Price Movement:** The close price (60.77) is higher than the open price (59.9), indicating a bullish candle.<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br />- SMA_50: 61.67<br />- SMA_200: 60.61<br />- EMA_50: 61.26<br />- EMA_200: 60.7<br /><br />The close price is above both the short-term and long-term moving averages, suggesting an uptrend.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI_14):** The RSI_14 value is 51.39, which is a neutral value.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br />- MACD_12_26_12: -0.64<br />- MACDh_12_26_12: Positive<br /><br />The MACD histogram is positive, which is a bullish sign, but the MACD value is negative, indicating bearish momentum.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:** The close price (60.77) is near the upper band (62.31), indicating a potential downward correction.<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:**<br />- STOCHk_14_3_3: 82.4<br />- STOCHd_14_3_3: 78.8<br /><br />These high values suggest that the close price is near the high of the period, and the market might be overbought.<br /><br />**Conclusion:** The last closing candle is bullish, but there are mixed signals in the technical indicators.

This indicates that the asset might be oversold and could potentially rebound, but the bearish trend should be taken into account.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**<br /><br />The MACD_12_26_12 (Moving Average Convergence Divergence with a 12-day and 26-day exponential moving average, and a 12-day signal line) shows a bearish signal, as the MACD line (12-day EMA - 26-day EMA) is below the signal line (-2.22 < -0.58).<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands, Keltner Channel, and Percentage Price Oscillator**<br /><br />The BBL_20_2.0, BBM_20_2.0, BBU_20_2.0, BBB_20_2.0, BBP_20_2.0 (Bollinger Bands, Keltner Channel, and Percentage Price Oscillator) indicators do not provide clear bullish or bearish signals, but they are generally consistent with the bearish trend.<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator**<br /><br />The STOCHk_14_3_3 and STOCHd_14_3_3 (Stochastic Oscillator, slow %K and slow %D) indicators show a bearish signal, as the slow %K line (187.02) is below the slow %D line (200.02), and both lines are below 80, which is in the oversold region.<br /><br />**Average True Range Ratio (ATR)**<br /><br />The ATRr_14 (Average True Range ratio over 14 days) is 6.85, which is relatively low, indicating decreased volatility in the market.<br /><br />**Conclusion**<br /><br />In summary, the last closing candle, as of 2024-07-23, suggests a bearish trend for the market, with several indicators pointing to a potential oversold condition. However, the bearish trend should be taken into account, and traders and investors should exercise caution.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-22</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle Data (2024-07-22)**----------------------------------<br /><br />| Property        | Value          |<br />| --------------- | -------------- |<br />| Open            | 191.0          |<br />| High            | 195.5          |<br />| Low             | 189.05         |<br />| Close           | 194.97         |<br />| Volume          | 7581000        |<br /><br />**Comparison with Previous Price Data**----------------------------------<br /><br />The last closing candle's open price (191.0) is lower than the previous candle's close (194.97), indicating a potential downward trend.

The 50-day moving average (EMA 50) was 67.34, while the 200-day moving average (EMA 200) was 58.34, with the EMA 50 above the EMA 200.

The Bollinger Bands (BBL 20 2.0, BBM 20 2.0, BBU 20 2.0, BBB 20 2.0, BBP 20 2.0) showed a narrowing range, which might suggest a potential breakout or a continuation of the current trend.<br /><br />The stochastic oscillator (STOCHk 14 3 3, STOCHd 14 3 3) was above 50, indicating that the asset might still be in an uptrend. However, the bearish divergence between the stochastic and the price action suggests that the uptrend might be weakening.<br /><br />**Recommendation:**<br /><br />It is recommended to be cautious and monitor the price action closely. A break below the lower Bollinger Band or the 200-day moving average could be a bearish signal, while a break above the upper Bollinger Band or the 50-day moving average could be a bullish signal.<br /><br />It is important to note that this analysis is based solely on the provided price data and technical indicators, and it does not take into account any fundamental analysis or market conditions.

The ATRr 14 (9.65) is relatively high, indicating high volatility in the market.<br /><br />**Conclusion**<br /><br />Based on the technical indicators, the last closing candle suggests a bearish outlook. However, the RSI 14 being close to the oversold region and the negative STOCH indicators may indicate that the downtrend is nearing its end. It is essential to monitor the price action and indicators closely for potential reversal signals.

The price has been in an uptrend in the short term, as indicated by the closing price being above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also above 50, indicating that the bullish momentum is still present.<br /><br />However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram is starting to flatten, which could be a sign that the uptrend is losing some momentum. The Bollinger Bands are expanding, indicating increasing volatility in the market. The price is currently near the upper Bollinger Band, which could be a sign of overbought conditions. However, the price has been able to break above the upper Bollinger Band in the past, so this may not necessarily be a bearish signal.<br /><br />Overall, the last closing candle suggests that the market is still in a bullish trend, but there are some signs that the uptrend may be losing some momentum. Investors and traders may want to exercise caution and consider taking profits or implementing risk management strategies. However, based on the information provided, there is no clear signal to be bullish, bearish, or neutral. It is recommended to consider other factors and indicators before making a decision.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-25</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-25<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 115.17<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 115.17<br /><br />**High Price:** 118.03<br /><br />**Low Price:** 114.57<br /><br />**Volume:** 12,200,642<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| Indicator | Value |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| SMA_50 | 114.23 |<br />| SMA_200 | 109.23 |<br />| EMA_50 | 114.43 |<br />| EMA_200 | 111.23 |<br />| RSI_14 | 58.12 |<br />| MACD_12_26_12 | 0.34 |<br /><br />**Trend Analysis:**<br /><br />The last closing candle indicates a slightly bullish trend, as the close price is higher than the previous day's close and above the SMA_50 and EMA_50.
