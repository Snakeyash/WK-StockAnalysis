The open price for the same day was slightly lower than the previous day's closing price. The high for the day was the same as the previous day's closing price, while the low was lower.<br /><br />The 50-day SMA and 200-day SMA are currently at 205.29 and 189.26, respectively. The stock is trading above both its short-term and long-term moving averages, which is typically a bullish sign. However, the stock's EMAs tell a different story. The 50-day EMA is 210.0, and the 200-day EMA is 194.39, indicating that the stock's short-term trend is downward, while its long-term trend is still upward.<br /><br />The stock's RSI is 48.57, which is in neutral territory and does not provide a clear signal. However, the stock's MACD is negative, with a value of -1.54, indicating that the stock's short-term trend is downward.<br /><br />The stock's Bollinger Bands are somewhat bearish. The stock is currently trading near the lower end of its Bollinger Band, indicating that it may be oversold. However, the stock's BandWidth (BW) is relatively narrow, suggesting that the stock's volatility is low.<br /><br />Finally, the stock's Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is -0.12, indicating that there is more selling pressure than buying pressure in the stock. This is a bearish sign.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle suggests that the stock may be experiencing some downward pressure in the short term, as evidenced by its lower close and negative MACD and CMF values. However, the stock's long-term trend is still upward, and it is currently trading above both its short-term and long-term moving averages. Therefore, a neutral to slightly bearish stance may be appropriate at this time. However, investors should conduct their own research and consider their own risk tolerance and investment goals before making any investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-17</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Closing Price** __________________________________________<br />The stock closed at 228.88 on 2024-07-17.<br /><br />**Percentage Change** ______________________________________<br />This represents a decrease of 2.48% from the previous close of 234.82.<br /><br />**Open, High, and Low Prices** ______________________________<br />Open price: 231.46<br />High: 232.33<br />Low: 226.64<br /><br />**Moving Averages** _______________________________________<br />50-day SMA: 204.44<br />200-day SMA: 186.87<br />50-day EMA: 203.53<br />200-day EMA: 186.58<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI)** _____________________________<br />RSI for the last closing candle: 4.91<br />Neutral zone: 30-70<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)** _______________<br />MACD line (12-26-12): below signal line<br />Histogram: negative<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands** ________________________________________<br />Stock price below lower band: bearish signal<br />Bandwidth: 5.15<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator (14,3,3)** _____________________________<br />Current value: 8.1<br />Strong bearish signal: below 20<br /><br />**Technical Indicators Summary** _____________________________<br />Based on the last closing candle's data and technical indicators, the stock market is showing bearish signals.

The MACD line has crossed below the signal line, and the RSI is in the neutral zone.

The upper wick of 0.99 and lower wick of 1.40 suggest that the market tested both resistance and support levels during the period but ultimately closed near the high of the day.<br /><br />The bullish engulfing pattern is often interpreted as a sign of a potential trend reversal. This pattern suggests that the bulls have taken control of the market and that the price may continue to rise.<br /><br />However, it is essential to note that technical analysis should not be used in isolation and should be complemented with other forms of analysis, such as fundamental analysis. While the last closing candle is a bullish signal, it does not guarantee that the price will continue to rise.

Stochastic Oscillator: The Stochastic Oscillator is at 94.56, which is above 80, indicating that the stock is overbought.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle shows mixed signals. The stock price is higher than the previous day, and the MACD is positive, which are bullish signs. However, the RSI and Stochastic Oscillator indicate that the stock is overbought, which could lead to a bearish reversal. Additionally, the volume is lower than the previous day, which could be a bearish sign.<br /><br />Therefore, it is recommended to be cautious and monitor the stock closely for further developments. It may be a good idea to wait for a pullback before entering a long position. Alternatively, shorting the stock could be considered if the bearish signals become more pronounced. Overall, a neutral to slightly bearish stance is recommended based on the last closing candle.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-15</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-16<br /><br />**Stock Closing Price:** 565.71<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 560.23<br /><br />**Trading Volume:** 1,884,973<br /><br />**50-Day and 200-Day Simple Moving Averages (SMA):**<br /><br />| SMA Period | Value |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| 50-day | 502.91 |<br />| 200-day | 544.94 |<br /><br />**50-Day and 200-Day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA):**<br /><br />| EMA Period | Value |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| 50-day | 502.91 |<br />| 200-day | 544.94 |<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI) - 14-day:** 67.46<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) - 12, 26, and 9-day:**<br /><br />| MACD Line | Signal Line |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| 14.82 | -0.28 |<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands - 20-day:**<br /><br />| Upper Band | Lower Band | BBW |<br />| --- | --- | --- |<br />| 588.46 | 553.55 | 12.75 |<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator - 14-day:** 66.12<br /><br />**Stochastic %K and %D:**<br /><br />| %K | %D |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| 66.12 | 63.58 |<br /><br />**Analysis:**<br /><br />The stock closed at 565.71 on 2024-07-15, which is higher than the opening price of 560.23, indicating a potential bullish sentiment. However, the trading volume for this period was relatively low at 1,884,973, which could suggest a lack of conviction among buyers.<br /><br />The stock's SMA and EMA for the 50 and 200-day periods are 502.91 and 544.94, respectively. The stock is currently trading above both its SMA and EMA, which is typically a bullish sign. However, the 50-day EMA is starting to flatten, which could indicate a potential slowdown in the stock's upward momentum.<br /><br />The stock's RSI for the 14-day period is 67.46, which is above the neutral level of 50, indicating that the stock is currently overbought. This could suggest that the stock may be due for a correction in the near term.<br /><br />The stock's MACD for the 12, 26, and 9-day periods is 14.82, -0.28, and -18.28, respectively. The MACD line is above the signal line, indicating a bullish trend. However, the MACD histogram is starting to narrow, which could suggest a potential slowdown in the stock's upward momentum.<br /><br />The stock's Bollinger Bands for the 20-day period show that the stock is currently trading near the upper band, indicating that the stock is overbought. The Bollinger Band Width (BBW) for the 20-day period is 12.75, which is relatively high, indicating that the stock has been experiencing high volatility.<br /><br />The stock's Stochastic Oscillator for the 14-day period is 66.12, which is above the neutral level of 50, indicating that the stock is currently overbought. The Stochastic %K line is above the Stochastic %D line, indicating a bullish trend. However, the Stochastic %K line is starting to flatten, which could suggest a potential slowdown in the stock's upward momentum.<br /><br />In summary, the last closing candle suggests a potential bullish sentiment, with the stock trading above both its SMA and EMA. However, the stock's RSI, MACD, and Stochastic Oscillator all indicate that the stock is currently overbought, which could suggest a potential correction in the near term. Additionally, the stock's low trading volume and narrowing MACD histogram could suggest a potential slowdown in the stock's upward momentum. Therefore, it may be advisable to adopt a neutral to slightly bearish stance in the near term.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-12</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td

The open price was **1074.52**, the high was **1077.05**, the low was **1060.74**, and the close was **1068.19**.<br /><br />**Characteristics of the Last Closing Candle:**<br /><br />This candle can be characterized as a small real body with a slight upper shadow and no lower shadow, which is also known as a "doji." A doji indicates indecision or a balance between buyers and sellers, as the open and close prices are very close to each other.<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />1. **Simple Moving Averages (SMA):**<br />   - 50-day SMA: **999.06**<br />   - 200-day SMA: **845.92**<br />   The close price is above both the short-term and long-term moving averages, which can be interpreted as a bullish sign. However, the close is relatively close to the 50-day SMA, suggesting that the stock might face some resistance at this level.<br />2. **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA):**<br />   - 50-day EMA: **1002.86**<br />   - 200-day EMA: **852.4**<br />   Similar to the SMAs, the close price is above both the short-term and long-term EMAs, indicating a bullish trend.<br />3. **Relative Strength Index (RSI):**<br />   - 14-day RSI: **48.29**<br />   The 14-day RSI is close to the neutral level of 50. This indicates that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, and there is no clear momentum in either direction.<br />4. **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br />   - MACD line: **-1.52**<br />   - Signal line: **-1.47**<br />   The MACD line is below the signal line, which can be interpreted as a bearish sign. However, the difference between the two lines is minimal, suggesting that the bearish signal is weak.<br />5. **Bollinger Bands:**<br />   - The close price is near the lower Bollinger Band, which can be seen as a bearish sign. However, the doji pattern indicates indecision, so this might not be a strong signal.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />Based on the analysis of the last closing candle and the relevant technical indicators, it is difficult to make a clear determination of whether the stock is a good buy or not. The doji pattern suggests indecision, and the close price is close to the 50-day SMA and near the lower Bollinger Band, which can be interpreted as bearish signals. However, the close price is above both the short-term and long-term moving averages, indicating a bullish trend.<br /><br />Given the mixed signals, it might be best to adopt a neutral or cautiously bullish stance. Investors could consider waiting for further confirmation of the trend before making a decision.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-15</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-16<br /><br />**Stock Closing Price:** 1063.63<br /><br />**Change from Previous Close:** -3.13%<br /><br />**50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA):** 1002.01<br /><br />**200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA):** 932.87<br /><br />**50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA):** 1000.7<br /><br />**200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA):** 939.01<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 49.29<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** -1.46<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />* Lower Band: 947.53<br />* Middle Band: 971.77<br />* Upper Band: 996.01<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:** 21.05<br /><br />**Analysis:**<br /><br />The stock closed at 1063.63 on 2024-07-15, which represents a decrease of 3.13% compared to the previous close.

While there are bullish signs, such as the price closing near the day's high and being above the moving averages, there are also bearish signs, such as the low RSI, the small gap between the price and EMA 200, and the high Stochastic Oscillator. Therefore, it is recommended to be cautious and consider both bullish and bearish scenarios. A potential strategy could be to wait for a confirmation of the reversal, such as a break below the SMA 50 or EMA 50, before making a decision. Alternatively, one could consider taking a neutral position and waiting for a clearer trend to emerge.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr class='parent-row sell sell_daily' id='CRM'><td>CRM</td><td>Salesforce Inc.

The following technical indicators were analyzed to gain a more informed perspective on the market.<br /><br />**Simple Moving Averages (SMA):**<br /><br />The 50-day SMA was 155.15, and the 200-day SMA was 155.08. The closing price being above both short-term and long-term SMAs is a bullish sign.<br /><br />**Exponential Moving Averages (EMA):**<br /><br />The 50-day EMA was 155.21, and the 200-day EMA was 155.1. The closing price being above both EMAs is also a bullish indicator.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):**<br /><br />The 14-period RSI was 47.81, which is close to the neutral zone (50). This indicates that the asset is not overbought or oversold, leaving room for price movement in either direction.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />The MACD line was -0.02, and the signal line was 0.01. The MACD line being below the signal line is typically a bearish sign. However, the difference between the two lines was minimal, suggesting that the bearish signal was weak.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />The closing price was near the lower Bollinger Band, indicating that the price may have been oversold in the short term. However, the price remained within the bands, suggesting that the overall trend was still intact.<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:**<br /><br />The 14-period %K line was 45.62, and the 14-period %D line was 45.62. Both lines were in the neutral zone (below 80 and above 20), indicating that the asset was not overbought or oversold.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />Based on the analysis of the last closing candle and the technical indicators, the market appears to be in a state of indecision. While the closing price is above the SMAs and EMAs, the MACD and Stochastic Oscillator indicators suggest that the asset may be due for a correction. However, the weak bearish signals and the fact that the price remains within the Bollinger Bands indicate that the overall trend remains bullish. Therefore, it may be a good time to adopt a neutral-to-bullish stance, with a focus on closely monitoring the asset's performance and adjusting positions as necessary. It is essential to consider other market factors and risk management strategies when making investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='child-table CVX'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent CVX'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-18</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-19<br /><br />**Stock Closing Price:** 161.97<br /><br />**Change from Previous Day:** 0.59<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 161.23<br /><br />**High Price:** 164.28<br /><br />**Low Price:** 160.24<br /><br />**Trading Volume:** 6,576,100<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA): 157.92<br />* 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA): 154.08<br />* 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA): 157.91<br />* 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA): 154.16<br />* Relative Strength Index (RSI): 65.04<br />* Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) Histogram: 0.59<br />* MACD Signal Line: 0.93<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />The stock's closing price on July 18, 2024, was 161.97, representing an increase of 0.59 from the previous day's closing price.

Therefore, it may be a good time to be bullish on the stock, but it's important to monitor the Stochastic Oscillator and Bollinger Bands for signs of a correction.

This suggests that the stock may be due for a correction.<br /><br />**Conclusion:** The last closing candle indicates a strong uptrend, with the stock trading above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages and the short-term trend stronger than the long-term trend. However, the stock may be overbought, as indicated by the RSI, stochastic oscillator, and Bollinger Bands. Therefore, while the trend is bullish, it may be prudent to exercise caution and consider taking profits or implementing a trailing stop loss.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-12</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle:** 2024-07-12<br /><br />| **Metric**          | **Value** |<br />|---------------------|-----------|<br />| Open                | 355.0     |<br />| High                | 363.95    |<br />| Low                 | 354.09    |<br />| Close               | 359.77    |<br />| Adj Close           | 359.77    |<br />| Volume             | 4019400  |<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| **Indicator**        | **Value** |<br />|----------------------|-----------|<br />| SMA_50              | 339.47    |<br />| SMA_200             | 337.85    |<br />| EMA_50              | 337.85    |<br />| EMA_200             | 339.15    |<br />| RSI_14              | 68.28     |<br />| MACD_12_26_12      | 12.44     |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12    | 12.44     |<br />| MACDs_12_26_12    | 12.44     |<br />| BBL_20_2.0         | 319.22    |<br />| BBM_20_2.0         | 361.66    |<br />| BBU_20_2.0         | 394.03    |<br />| BBB_20_2.0         | 329.28    |<br />| BBP_20_2.0         | 359.77    |<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3      | 98        |<br />| STOCHd_14_3_3      | 98        |<br />| ATRr_14             | 6.87      |<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />The last closing candle (2024-07-12) exhibits a bullish character, as the closing price is higher than both the opening price and the previous day's closing price.

However, the lower volume and overbought technical indicators suggest that the stock may be due for a correction in the short term.

This indicates that there was some decent interest in the stock on this day, but it was not an extraordinarily high volume day.<br /><br />**Moving Averages**<br />------------------<br /><br />The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) for the stock is **62.94**, while the 200-day SMA is **59.0**. This means that the stock is currently trading above both its short-term and long-term moving averages, which is a bullish sign. However, the fact that the 50-day SMA is very close to the price of the last closing candle may indicate that the stock is due for a correction in the near future.<br /><br />The exponential moving averages (EMAs) for the past 50 and 200 days are also bullish, with the 50-day EMA at **62.91** and the 200-day EMA at **59.5**. This means that the short-term trend for the stock is up, and it has been for some time.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI)**<br />-------------------------------<br /><br />The RSI for the past 14 days is **47.0**, which is in neutral territory. This means that the stock is not overbought or oversold, and there is no immediate indication of a trend change.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**<br />---------------------------------------------<br /><br />The MACD for the past 12, 26, and 9 days is also in neutral territory, with the signal line and the histogram both hovering around zero. This indicates that there is no clear trend in the stock's momentum at the moment.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands**<br />------------------<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands for the past 20 days are relatively tight, with the upper band at **64.24**, the middle band at **62.83**, and the lower band at **61.42**. This indicates that the stock is currently trading within a narrow range, and any breakout above or below the bands could signal a trend change.<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator**<br />-----------------------<br /><br />The stochastic oscillator for the past 14 days is also in neutral territory, with the %K line at **50.3** and the %D line at **50.0**. This means that the stock is not overbought or oversold, and there is no immediate indication of a trend change.<br /><br />**Conclusion**<br />------------<br /><br />Based on this analysis, the last closing candle does not provide a clear indication of whether the stock is a good buy or not. The stock is currently trading above its short-term and long-term moving averages, which is a bullish sign. However, the small size of the candle's body and the fact that the 50-day SMA is very close to the price may indicate that the stock is due for a correction in the near future. The RSI, MACD, and stochastic oscillator are all in neutral territory, which further complicates the picture. Therefore, it may be wise to wait for a clearer signal before making a decision to buy or sell this stock. Investors could consider waiting for a breakout above or below the Bollinger Bands, or for a clear trend to emerge in the RSI, MACD, or stochastic oscillator. Alternatively, investors could consider looking at other technical or fundamental indicators to help make their decision.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-09</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-09<br /><br />**Closing Price:** $62.69<br /><br />**Change:** $0.34 (-0.54%)<br /><br />**Open Price:** $63.06<br /><br />**High:** $63.23<br /><br />**Low:** $62.59<br /><br />**50-day SMA:** $62.92<br /><br />**200-day SMA:** $59.59<br /><br />**50-day EMA:** $62.92<br /><br />**200-day EMA:** $59.59<br /><br />**14-day RSI:** 45.35<br /><br />**MACD Histogram:** -0.12<br /><br />**MACD Signal Line:** -0.04<br /><br />**MACD Line:** -0.2<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />* Lower Band: $62.41<br />* Middle Band: $62.69<br />* Upper Band: $62.97<br /><br />**Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E):** N/A<br /><br />The **closing price** on July 9, 2024, was $62.69, which represents a decrease of $0.34 or 0.54% compared to the previous closing price.

This suggests that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, and that there is no clear momentum in either direction.<br /><br />The MACD indicators are relatively flat, with the MACD line at -0.06 and the signal line at 0.18. This suggests that there is no clear trend in the stock's momentum.<br /><br />Based on this analysis, the stock's last closing candle does not provide a clear indication of whether it is a good time to be bullish, bearish, or neutral. The stock is currently trading above its short-term and long-term moving averages, but it has been below the 200-day SMA for much of the past 90 days. The RSI and MACD indicators are also relatively flat, suggesting a lack of clear momentum.<br /><br />Therefore, traders and investors may want to wait for further price action and technical signals before making any decisions about buying or selling this stock. It may be prudent to wait for a clearer trend to emerge before taking a bullish or bearish position.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr class='parent-row inconclusive inconclusive_daily' id='ORCL'><td>ORCL</td><td>Oracle Corporation Common Stock</td><td>2024-07-12</td><td>neutral</td></tr><tr class='explanation-table ORCL'><td colspan='4'>**Weekly Stock Market Report**<br /><br />**July 8, 2024**<br /><br />*Closing Price:* **144.77**<br /><br />**Key Statistics:**<br /><br />| Metric          | Value                 |<br />|------------------|-----------------------|<br />| Open Price       | 144.76                |<br />| High Price       | 145.7                 |<br />| Low Price        | 138.0                 |<br />| Close Price      | 144.77                |<br />| Volume           | 49,242,234            |<br /><br />**Trend Analysis:**<br /><br />The most recent closing candle occurred on July 8, 2024, with a closing price of 144.77.

However, the bands have been expanding, indicating increasing volatility and potential for further gains.<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator:** The stochastic oscillator is also showing a bullish signal, with the %K line crossing above the %D line.

However, the RSI and Bollinger Bands suggest that the stock may be overbought in the short term and due for a correction. Therefore, it may be advisable to wait for a pullback before entering a long position. Alternatively, investors may consider taking profits if they are already long on the stock. A neutral to slightly bullish stance is recommended.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-16</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report** (2024-07-16)<br /><br />**Closing Price:** 164.76<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 163.41<br /><br />**High:** 165.04<br /><br />**Low:** 162.84<br /><br />**Volume:** 4461000<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| **Indicator** | **Value** |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| SMA_50 | 170.88 |<br />| SMA_200 | 168.65 |<br />| EMA_50 | 168.24 |<br />| EMA_200 | 170.91 |<br />| RSI_14 | -1.62 |<br />| MACD_12_26_12 | 0.48 |<br />| MACD_signal line | -2.09 |<br />| BBL_20_2.0 (Lower Band) | 161.63 |<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3 | 161.63 |<br />| ATRr_14 | 2.75 |<br /><br />**Price Movement:** The closing price of 164.76 is higher than the opening price of 163.41, indicating an upward price movement during the period.<br /><br />**Volume:** The volume for the last candle is 4461000, which is lower than the previous candle's volume of 4551800, indicating decreased trading activity.<br /><br />**Moving Averages:** The SMA_50 is 170.88, and the SMA_200 is 168.65.

The price is slightly above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which could be seen as a positive sign for buyers. However, the RSI is at 58.05, which is close to the neutral level of 50, and the MACD histogram is positive but relatively small, indicating that the short-term momentum may be waning.<br /><br />Additionally, the Bollinger Bands are relatively wide, suggesting that the stock price may be volatile in the near term. The price is near the upper Bollinger Band, which could be a bearish sign, but the BBP is also near the upper Bollinger Band, indicating that the price may be overbought but not necessarily overvalued.<br /><br />The Stochastic Oscillator is also indicating that the stock may be overbought, with both the %K and %D lines above 80. However, this could also be a sign of a strong uptrend, so it is important to consider other indicators as well.<br /><br />Overall, the last closing candle does not provide a clear signal for investors. While there are some positive signs, such as the price being above the moving averages, there are also some potential warning signs, such as the overbought indicators. Therefore, it may be best to take a neutral stance and wait for further confirmation of the trend before making any investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-10</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle**<br />---------------------<br /><br />The last closing candle in the provided 90 days of price data is for the date **2024-07-10**.

Therefore, while the trend is bullish, investors should be cautious and consider taking profits or implementing stop-loss orders.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr class='parent-row sell sell_daily' id='TSM'><td>TSM</td><td>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd.</td><td>2024-07-12</td><td>bearish</td></tr><tr class='explanation-table TSM'><td colspan='4'>**Weekly Stock Market Analysis Report**<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle:** 2024-07-08<br /><br />| **Metric**          | **Value** |<br />|---------------------|-----------|<br />| Open                | 190.0     |<br />| High                | 193.47    |<br />| Low                 | 182.5     |<br />| Close               | 187.35    |<br />| Adj Close           | 187.35    |<br />| Volume             | 120569285 |<br />| SMA 50             | 121.2     |<br />| SMA 200            | 106.23    |<br />| EMA 50             | 121.2     |<br />| EMA 200            | 106.23    |<br />| RSI 14             | 50.67     |<br />| MACD 12 26 12     | -0.08, 0.54, -0.62 |<br />| BBL 20 2.0        | 172.44    |<br />| BBM 20 2.0        | 187.35    |<br />| BBU 20 2.0        | 192.26    |<br />| BBB 20 2.0        | 162.44    |<br />| BBP 20 2.0        | 180.35    |<br />| STOCHk 14 3 3     | 47.62     |<br />| STOCHd 14 3 3     | 38.46     |<br />| ATRr 14            | 10.86     |<br /><br />**Analysis:**<br /><br />The last closing candle for the weekly chart, ending on 2024-07-08, has the following properties:<br /><br />- Open: 190.0<br />- High: 193.47<br />- Low: 182.5<br />- Close: 187.35<br />- Adj Close: 187.35<br />- Volume: 120569285<br />- SMA 50: 121.2 (50-week Simple Moving Average)<br />- SMA 200: 106.23 (200-week Simple Moving Average)<br />- EMA 50: 121.2 (50-week Exponential Moving Average)<br />- EMA 200: 106.23 (200-week Exponential Moving Average)<br />- RSI 14: 50.67 (14-week Relative Strength Index)<br />- MACD 12 26 12: -0.08, MACDh 12 26 12: 0.54, MACDs 12 26 12: -0.62 (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence)<br />- BBL 20 2.0: 172.44, BBM 20 2.0: 187.35, BBU 20 2.0: 192.26, BBB 20 2.0: 162.44, BBP 20 2.0: 180.35 (Bollinger Bands)<br />- STOCHk 14 3 3: 47.62, STOCHd 14 3 3: 38.46 (14-week Stochastic Oscillator)<br />- ATRr 14: 10.86 (14-week Average True Range)<br /><br />The last closing candle indicates that the stock price opened at 190.0, reached a high of 193.47, and closed at 187.35 for the week.

The trading volume for this period was significantly higher than usual, with approximately 52,821,200 shares traded, compared to an average volume of around 15,683,100 shares.<br /><br />The stock's 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is 166.18, and the 200-day SMA is 154.97. The stock is currently trading above both its short-term and long-term moving averages, which could be a bullish signal. However, the stock's relative strength index (RSI) for the past 14 periods is 42.54, which is below the neutral threshold of 50, indicating that the stock may be oversold.<br /><br />Additionally, the stock's moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is negative, with a value of -1.54, suggesting that the stock's short-term momentum is bearish. The MACD line is also below the signal line, which could be a bearish signal. However, the stock's Bollinger bands, which measure volatility, are relatively narrow, indicating that the stock's price may be due for a breakout.<br /><br />Overall, the last closing candle suggests that the stock may be experiencing some downward pressure in the short term, as evidenced by the decrease in price and the negative MACD histogram. However, the stock's position above its moving averages and the narrow Bollinger bands suggest that there may be potential for a bullish reversal in the near future.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-17</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-18<br /><br />**Stock Closing Price:** 171.2<br /><br />**Change from Previous Close:** -1.04 points or -0.57%<br /><br />**Open Price:** 176.58<br /><br />**High:** 176.58<br /><br />**Low:** 170.51<br /><br />**Trading Volume:** 44,773,500 (compared to an average volume of 15,000,000)<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA): 165.6<br />* 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA): 127.09<br />* 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA): 165.01<br />* 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA): 126.67<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* Relative Strength Index (RSI): 50.23<br />* Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): -0.56, -1.46, signal line at -2.32<br />* Bollinger Bands: Middle band at 171.2, upper band at 186.54, lower band at 155.84<br />* Stochastic Oscillator: 3.89<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />The stock closed at 171.2 on 2024-07-17, marking a decrease of 1.04 points or 0.57% from the previous close.

This indicates that the long-term and medium-term trends are bullish.<br /><br />The RSI_14 is at 73.6, which is above 70, suggesting that the stock is overbought. This might indicate a potential downward correction in the short term. However, the recent uptrend has been strong, and the overbought condition may persist for some time.<br /><br />The MACD_12_26_12 (14.21, 10.03, 4.19) is positive, with the signal line (10.03) and the histogram (4.19) above the zero line, further supporting the bullish outlook.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands (BB) indicate that the price is near the upper band (567.05), which is consistent with the overbought condition. However, the price has been consistently trading near the upper band for an extended period, suggesting that the uptrend might continue.<br /><br />The Stochastic Oscillator (STOCHk_14_3_3) is also overbought, with both the %K and %D lines above 80. This further supports the possibility of a short-term downward correction.<br /><br />In summary, the last closing candle indicates a strong bullish trend, but the overbought conditions suggest a potential short-term downward correction. Investors should be aware of the possibility of a correction, but the overall trend remains bullish. Therefore, it can be a good time to be bullish, but cautiously so, considering the potential for a short-term pullback.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-07-17</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-07-18<br /><br />**Stock Price:**<br /><br />- **Closing Price:** 573.28<br />- **Open Price:** 551.12<br />- **High Price:** 582.35<br />- **Low Price:** 550.05<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />**1.
